Just wanted to let the devs know that the app was not able to connect to the BIMB server after the latest update. I tried updating, clearing cache, clearing storage and nothing works. It only worked again after reinstalling the app. I loved the app but it will be even more amazing if the GUI is more fluid, though that's just me being picky. Hopefully the next update is smooth as it's been a recurring issue. Kudos to the devs.
Please fix the app. Sometimes it takes time to load, unable to connect to server but when accessing internet banking through the browser works just fine. A few times I had to reinstall the app just to fix the server error. It annoys me because clearing cache doesn't help at all to reset the connection to server. Why is that a problem? Basically the app becomes completely useless when the error starts popping up, reinstalling is the only option. We use this almost daily now.
Previous version apps are more batter than current apps. After I updated to a new apps the apps seems having a bad issues. 1. It is hard to open, and it takes more time to open. Loading too long. 2. Even though1 managed to log in, when I choose, as an example, to transfer a money, the apps will be loaded again, and it takes a long time to load. 3. Not so friendly like before, because when I would like to check other things inside the apps, the same issue happens. Please make changes

NOT USER FRIENDLY AT ALL!!! Last review, 1 star on December 2022, until today Nov 2024, this apps does not improve much. They include fingerprint to make the access easier, but not easy at all. I can easily access to see ny account with 1 time using fingerprint eith other banking apps, but not with this app. To open each section, it loading for so long. To get approval for transaction also take some time. What's the point moving to 5G era, but your app still slow.
for the past week I couldn't get pass the starting screen of the app and thus i can never access the app anymore. i have checked if there's any update but there were none and my phone meets the app requirement system. the web browser works fine but it is frustrating bc i can't use the app anymore to do instant transfers. fix this issue please this is too absurd
Cannot launch the app. Tried everything and yet the login page never appear, stucked at the front page forever. Read the latest reviews, and the developer keep on telling to update to latest version (3.2.09), which is what everyone already have update to, or use phone with android 9 and above. No solution or whatsover. Very disappointed with how little they care about clients' experience.
The app is so slow, and it will not open at all. I have to uninstall the app and reinstall it every time i want to use the app. After reinstalling, I can only use it once. The second time I try to use it, the same thing happens, and I will have to uninstall again. After reinstalling the app, I can't make any transfers to other banks for the next 12 hours. I feel like closing my account just because of this. This app is not convenient at all. In fact, it is troublesome to the users.
Too many errors occuring from time to time Either not being able to log in, not able to use the QR, and even worse, not even able to open the apps even after waiting for quite some time. Had to uninstall then reinstall the app. It is annoying as you need to enter your data all over again
PLEASE DO SOMETHING TO THE APPS!! after installed the updated version, it is always loading and stuck at the start up n i cant open the apps. Update on 28 oct 2023, i believe there is no improvement that bank islam done to their apps, which is super non friendly user, lagging, need to open and log in several times, i almost forget my password because rarely use it due to the issues.

Useless app !  Most of the time take time to load unable to connect to server. It's really frustrating. I had to reinstall the app when I need to do the transaction. Annoying !!!
i will close my account because if this incompetent app. now that you force to use app to validate any transfer but it does not even connect. i have clear cache, update, uninstall and reinstall before you even try to ask for me to update this app. even tried with wifi and my mobile 5G speed. this is just pure garbage of an app.
25/8/23: Guess I'm not changing my opinion anytime soon. Very, very rarely it was fast. Rest of the time? So slow that I forgot I have to pay for something. Now? I can't even go to the main page, keeps telling me to reinitiate transaction. WT--?? Like I have no life to live, is it, to wait for the app to actually work?
the most stupidest banking app.. it will take forever to load. on top of that if you want to perform duitnow transfer through the browser, you still need to open your go app. it's so annoying and it really makes me angry. i have very stable internet connection. Hey bimb please learn from cimb how to operate an app.
Unable to connect the server? Already update the latest version (as of 7 October 2023). Already uninstall and install again to see if it's working, but still doesn't working. If we need to call the center, every user of this app will end up calling Bank Islam. The problem is this app itself.
Very disappointing experience using bank islam go, it takes forever just to get to the log in screen, not to mention the problem while scanning qr codes and many more.. what's the point of yall taking RM 13 from our bank accounts if you didn't do anything to fix the goddamn app..no one will be furious if there is a slight inconvenience for a short period of time, but this app has been giving people nothing but trouble for quite some time..please step up your IT teams
Why i kept getting error "400 bad request", although i already key in my correct password and id also the tac number. After that error, the app send me msg that i already registered yet unable to to log in. Please resolve this, i already uninstall and reinstall for several time.. Dear BIMB, Again this app really needs improvement. As from all customers that seems to have the same issues, we really need you to solves it fast for us to used it again.
Please please please do stg about the app start up, I can't open the app no matter how many times I tried, and since some transcation require verification from this app it's really frustrating! Why in the world does everything need verification from the app anyway, the duitnow I get, the jompay I get, but why funds transfer too????
Sometimes it's working.... sometimes NOT. It continues to buffer. So unfriendly users. In fact my phone is new, install & uninstall 3 times by now & updated the apps to the latest version. But still the SAME prob reoccurring. Fix you apps pls!
Too slow, the app keep loading and in the end, the session expired just like that. One more thing... it keeps telling us to UPDATE BUT NOTHING'S CHANGED!! STILL THE SAME PROBLEMS OCCUR WHILE USING THE APP!! Please make improvement on the app so that IT WILL BE EASIER FOR US, THE USER OF THE APP!!
Often to unistall and install. Also been waiting for the IAC to be send to my number take years. Requested for so many times still did not received any In case of emergency to do any transaction, this is very much troublesome. Transaction via website also need approval from GO Bimb. How to if I can't even open the apps ?
I will be honest. This app is the worst. The loading takes too long for me to open the app. If its only a minute or two is okay but it takes 5 mintues or even more just to load? I've heard the issue is not new which proves this app is just that bad.
I've already updated to the new version but still couldn't open the app.. I don't know why it cannot connect to the server. I've tried using both wifi and data but still can't open.
Very bad apps.. Always stuck and nothing happened after wait 10 minutes. Causing me very bad experience to transfer money using western Union and PFX with your apps. Very very very bad!!!!
the apps are so bad, clear cache, etc, still unable to open the apps. Online transactions through the website need approval through GO secure, but nothing can be approved since the apps only trying to load the entire time
Took super long to open the apps. Most of the time i gave up. Would rather transfer all my money to other banks, easier when i need to do duitnow payment at the store. Im super close to stop using this app.
I mean i understand that many people are using this app, but you have to accommodate good service to them. Make frequent maintenance, if u already did u have to make it even more frequent. Please people are just trying to get their transactions through and if u are wishing to keep them as customers, please improve.
Frequently got problem to share the transaction receipt. There are 2 ways to share receipt in GO apps .... thru (menu) history mobile transaction or thru individual account transaction history. Both got blank receipt. My phone OS is Android version 13. GO apps version 3.2.09.
The app was very very veryyyyyy slowwwwww!!!!!! Couldn't make any transactions with this app. I am beyond disappointed. Edit: after the recent update, there's no more slow loading so i think they deseve more star
i want to carry out fpx transaction. so i need to use go app to approve the transaction. and goes on loading till the last 120s of the transaction. and when i got at the login page press go secure to approve the transaction. it repeatly tell me the transaction has expired, when i still have 120s. i did a few more time with the same result till transaction have really expired. ok i give another go, i reinstall the app, reregistered it for 3 more time to do the fpx and it still waste my time
From bad to worse. It was already laggy and slow before. Since the update, takes close to forever to load(my internet is running at 500mbps) . And the interface is very buggy. I can't do any transactions just an endless loop of returning to the home screen. I end up using chrome or my PC for any online transactions. Please this app really needs a major update & revamp. At a time when most things are online you might loose more customers bcoz other app(bank) are better
If there is an option to give 0 star, damn sure I'd give it without hesitation. Every time updates coming this app has become much much worse than before. Please fix your app and your server so we can log in without issue. Fix the damn issue asap or else we will port to another bank.
Half an hour loading to open the apps. Very very very bad apps for such a big finance company. Please let us used the browser instead of this app.. I repeat.. Very.. Very....very very.. Bad and junk apps.
I hate this app ever.... From September until the end of October, this app can't perform well even i have updated it... I can't do anything to my money in the bank. Already made some reports via email and call centre for this issue. Seem like no action from them.
Not intuitive to use. I cancelled my transfer settings and press OK on the dialog option, nothing happened, not even to the homepage. I tap on back button and the app not responding at all. Can't even find ASNB account summary or related (not transaction) but the bank have that service, really not good. Edit: No error, I wrote "Nothing happened" means I got any feedback from that? No, you didn't code any error message. That's even worst.
Unable to login,Already clear and uninstall the app.Still get the same error. There is no more,Go secure for approve transaction purpose.It is very dangerous since no safety in online transaction. YES,this is the latest version of app.
Worst app ever exist! Very slow and u need to activate go secure even for small amount transfer. Waste of time!! Once lag, it's going to lag forever.. in the end, need to uninstall and install it again. No improvement despite people giving reviews. Don't bother to create an app if it's only cause trouble every time u need to use it!!
My rating for this app has plummeted significantly lately among financial apps that I've used. Worst experience and seems buggy, it hangs frequently and randomly unresponsive, not able to connect, etc. Not easy for online payment. Getting tired of all sorts of issue for a financial apps from a Bank. Really needs to buck up and hope security is no compromised though!
Greetings to whom it might concern. You are a bank institution. There supposedly should not be any crashes, trouble opening, and unable to connect to the server every time. Please do something about this. I am so tired of having to close and open the app every time I wanted to do transactions and approvals. Worst, re-installing for dozens of times. Thus, I had trouble making simple payments. I hope to actually use your banking app smoothly. I look foward to see some improvements.
I have no words for how much I hate this app. Recently updated, now my transfer limit can't be changed on the app. It's a different limit from the mobile site, and it's a ridiculously low limit that I can't do anything with. Uninstalling and reinstalling for the umpteenth time and hope (yet again) that this will fix the problem.
Im so proud of bank islam. Most of the time this app cannot work, always loading screen and server error. However, rather than solving this issue you guys have a great idea by making transactions approval using the go app. So if we successfully log into the portal using web browser, we still need to open the app which is 99% does not work. What a fantastic idea! Btw, stop using AI to reply all reviews. Clearing cache wil not solve anything for this garbage system
Please upgrade your apps. Tells me to update, after updating the app, it says cannot connect to the server. Need to uninstall and re-install. Tired of doing the same thing all over again...if i can give u zero star, i would. Worst banking app ever. I don't know how many times already i uninstall and reinstall your app. Don't tell me about phone spec, never encountered this problem on any other banking app. 😤
Worst ever online banking app I've ever experienced. After having to install, uninstall and reinstall, it still failed to function. Doesn't even deserve 1-star. Please buck up!! and emulate other banks' secure app that have been proven to perform, no need to reinvent the wheel, just get it sorted out before imposing on customers to use such app for our online banking transactions.
App not responsive to touch input on landing/login page. Uninstalled and reinstalled still unresponsive, cannot tap 'get started'. Hope can fix soon.
Actually not bad if you compare with other bank software. User friendly UI, Easy to use, just abit slow sometimes. Other all good for me.
After update, cannot connect to the server. Need to uninstall and install it again. Loading time too long when need to do secure pay, untill timeout. Not much improvement compare to other internet banking apps after a year from my last reviewed.
I can see this app is improving. My only complaint is that it would be nice if this app would let guest user login using the app that already has a registered user ID. Sometimes, I'm helping my mom doing online transactions when I was at hostel, so it was troublesome to deregistered my Go bank account just to use Go secure using my mom Go bank account.
the app just updated and now i can't even make it to the login screen because of "server error". it's a pain and i need to use the app for online and cashless transactions, do fix this problem ASAP
too many bugs,slow apps eventhough signal at the area in good condition, need to improve on the apps efficiency,unable to screenshot as a evidence while performing any transaction.
Slow loading apps. Very, very, very, slow loading apps. Not that user friendly. Always had trouble using this apps.
Asked me to update employment status when I tried to login through web browser but need to approve via app. Downloaded the app, but need to enable unnecessary permissions. When enabled, server connection error. Head father you, your mother green.
Loading too long. Sometimes not working. Been using for so long but the problem still the same. Never improve. Difficult when trying to pay with qr code cause need to wait for too long.
I tried to transfer money from using website, it refuses and ask me to use this app. But when I install the app and try to transfer, I keep getting error "You are not allowed to perform this monetary transaction for 12 hours".
At account details page, my money are still there but it keep decreasing at home pages. It's frustrating. I can't make transaction. It keeps saying i don't have balance left
Pure connection. Already update handphone to android 10, but still fail to connect, although after using variety of internet line.
Notice that there is improvement on the application, especially it is much faster than before, which makes QR payment is possible. Keep up the good work.
The newer version app has improved a lot. No more lagging. Easy to log in. Online transfer has been easy. A+ for team effort
Unable to login after newly installed in new phone. Keeps saying connection to server is lost. Please fix. Thank you.
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE fix your app sometimes it will suddenly became error and i need to reinstall it REINSTALL ITT !!! IT'S SO FRUSTRATING !!! BECAUSE I USED THIS APP FOR MY DAILY WHEN I REINSTALL IT AGAIN I NEED TO WAIT 24 HOURS TO DO THE TRANSACTION (24 HOURS 24 HOURS) YOU THINK I HAVE TIME TO WAITTTT. I already read someone chat and i read your reply . You said you already fixed it. But you lying the problem are still not fixed .
Edit Again: Alhamdulillah the app nowadays is usable enough. They get rid of the useless feature that caused the app unusable in the previous version
Now it's unusable. Keep giving me error code 500 (APZ_TSN_500). I did everything I could, reinstall, clear cache and data. Only work for a brief moment after I reinstall / clear data and it doesn't work after I close and try to open the app. For some reason, it works perfectly on my friends phone.
Every single time when I want to use go app , it crashed . Why can't you just like before ? Sending TAC through SMS , it's a lot more easier and after using GO app everything when really bad .
Hi again its me your customer. Recently I try to make a few purchases from tiktok shop but after the first purchase, the system started to go crazy and it can't even able to process my purchase anymore. It unfortunately cancelled out my promo payment hence why I'm rating it 1 star. Please kindly fix this issue.
lousy lousy lousy still..updated oct 2023 . Frustrating lately since up-dating this app recently, always unable to connect. Why give us this trouble now? after many years hassle free without un-install and install. Fix this!!! Nothing being done. Stop replying me the same stupid answer like the others.
I want to pay my uni fee, but I can't pay it through online because it's keep loading. I prefer, the old version where we just need to put code from SMS from need permission from aps. Because this app will stuck. I want to pay my uni fee!!!!
Sorry to say. Very bad and bad system ever. After update the latest one I cannot access my online banking. Always lagging all the time even though using wifi. Waste time waiting & drag my time also.
The apps took tooooo long to open since the update. It hinder all my transfer since it need go secure and the page won't open even the homepage. Please fix it asap
Worst bank app service ever. Low maintenance and really annoying to handle such simple tasks. Buffer all the time and not even a message to inform in the app have problems to be fixed.
Apps Loading time during peak and non peak hours are terrible. If other banks's apps can be efficient in terms of loading time and etc, bank islam should make initiatives to develop an app that is on par with other apps. Show some class 😮‍💨
Your notification was so bad. No information regarding the need to upgrade, uninstall and reinstall. Your sense of urgency is so bad that you not allow customer to perform transaction right after installing the app. Instead, you asked for a cooling off 12 hours? Are you running a beta version on BIMB customer? You made 12 hours of misery.
I cleared app cache and data. Tried again. Its working. Thank you. Just that the tag that comes in into the phone only works at the second attempt.. not the first.
Bad experience, and looks like no improvement even though customers rate low. I think you should test your apps thoroughly. It is still the same even you have upgraded the version. Please be serious on improving your customer experience.
I am using this app since last 3 years. This is so frustrating. The App doesn’t work when you need it the most. I think the developers of this App are too lazy to fix the issues. Going to switch to another bank this week. Bye bye Bank Islam.
cannot use during payday week, most of the time hang during transaction,go apps becomes not go apps..the 1st version way much better than current. What a dissapointed experienced!
Its getting worse..i hope you guys can fix this problem..its already a couple of days but i still can't login to the apps..i always update the apps..but it's doesn't seem to be a changes at all..
Truly disappointed! After so many attempt trying to login with password still invalid! We only able to login with same password and username thru website using chrome browser. Please do something with your crash app!
Very slow. Every day I will uninstall and reinstall back. Than need to wait another 12hrs for transfer. Poor app. Why keep continue such services. Very sorry. Very frustrating.
The worst experience ever in all history of Online Banking app. This app is super slow considering how every user's bank account need verification from this app and yet it took forever to load. Such disappointment
The previous version is much better than now. I can't even log in to do my transaction and there's always error that I getting annoyed now 😑. Please fix it quickly
The latest mandatory update is full of bugs. I can't open it well especially when I need to transfer my money. The previous version is way better.
Please make an improvement to your apps, I'm very frustrated and annoyed each time to make any payments because this apps keep take a long time on loading page before going to login page. Please Bank Islam, do better.
The apps is not workable, lagging and not able to log in all the times, resulting in broken dateline and promises( so not islamic at all). Pls pls do something or do we need to report to PMX as well. It has improved and i m satisfied now
After updating still no improvement. After one transaction succsess, next transaction always failed. Always need to log out and delete cache, then can do the transaction. Becoming worst every year.
Can't login, at first didn't approved access, then as it is compulsory, allowed the access, but get error "Unable to connect to the server" Off, clear cached, still can't get through
i can't log in Go By Bank Islam (it said Invalid Credential) eventhough i updated to the latest version and my device is not old version, i told to the email (contact centre) and no response at all, please fix it ASAP, i need to use the app
Just recently update the app, and now i can't even open it😑 it says can't connect to server. Edited: thank you Bank Islam. I follow ur instruction. I delete my app and install it again. It worked
One of the worst app that I ever downloaded. I used to pay via fpx online but after the new update, I need to get permission from this Go app and sometimes it doesn't even work and after the latest update I can't pay to purchase something online💆‍♂️
Very inconvenient. Unstable and non worked app. Cant even open the app and just keep loading. I want to give negative star for this useless thing. Rework this disappointing thing.
Cannot access Tabung Haji even with latest update. App condition somehow as if it's an app made by a guy who just build their first app. It's bank app so with current performance, it's a disappointment.
Told me to use the app instead of website. But the app cannot even open. So how can I transfer and stuff. So disappointed especially during emergency...
Why does it keep buffering? I'm unable to make any purchases. Help please Latest: I've already updated it. Still the same, is it need a very good internet connection?
Please I'm begging you please update and fix the system..its been down with server error for weeks and this is not the 1st time. Sometimes it takes hours just to load -whattt??
Hi there, what has happened to this app, I can't log in even i tried many time. Previous version has better version than this new version. Please improve this kind of problem.
Unusable. App will stay on the loading page endlessly. Its been going on for months! Update 02/10/2023: Latest updates makes it even worse. Did you guys hire a bunch monkeys to manage this app? Didn't gave them enough bananas?
apsal app ni slow sgt.. Bi kena lebih improve customer service n satisfaction ni.. 4 app yg lain semua jauh lbh lancar. Once account freezed, and it keep repeating wrong password.. and u have to wait for 12 hours to make a transaction, this is nonsense service.. I'll better move to other banks..
Worst mobile apps ever. It didn't work properly and not even able to open it most of the time especially for Android user.
The app some time not available as before . The loading process take a several times. Some time i got fed up with this app. Please make it smooth like your take it money from us.
for many times, i try and try but still cannot login and of course it happens during the most urgent period. worthless apps!
Previous update was better than current. Dont know if there any maintenance, app and web both take more time loading and lag when enter it. Please make good your system
Just wanted to let the devs know that the app was not able to connect to the BIMB server after the latest update. I tried updating, clearing cache, clearing storage and nothing works.

Often to unistall and install. Also been waiting for the IAC to be send to my number take years. Requested for so many times still did not received any In case of emergency to do any transaction, this is very much troublesome. Transaction via website also need approval from GO Bimb. How to if I can't even open the apps ?
I will be honest. This app is the worst. The loading takes too long for me to open the app. If its only a minute or two is okay but it takes 5 mintues or even more just to load? I've heard the issue is not new which proves this app is just that bad.
I've already updated to the new version but still couldn't open the app.. I don't know why it cannot connect to the server. I've tried using both wifi and data but still can't open.
Very bad apps.. Always stuck and nothing happened after wait 10 minutes. Causing me very bad experience to transfer money using western Union and PFX with your apps. Very very very bad!!!!
the apps are so bad, clear cache, etc, still unable to open the apps. Online transactions through the website need approval through GO secure, but nothing can be approved since the apps only trying to load the entire time
Took super long to open the apps. Most of the time i gave up. Would rather transfer all my money to other banks, easier when i need to do duitnow payment at the store. Im super close to stop using this app.
I mean i understand that many people are using this app, but you have to accommodate good service to them. Make frequent maintenance, if u already did u have to make it even more frequent. Please people are just trying to get their transactions through and if u are wishing to keep them as customers, please improve.
Frequently got problem to share the transaction receipt. There are 2 ways to share receipt in GO apps .... thru (menu) history mobile transaction or thru individual account transaction history. Both got blank receipt. My phone OS is Android version 13. GO apps version 3.2.09.
The app was very very veryyyyyy slowwwwww!!!!!! Couldn't make any transactions with this app. I am beyond disappointed. Edit: after the recent update, there's no more slow loading so i think they deseve more star
i want to carry out fpx transaction. so i need to use go app to approve the transaction. and goes on loading till the last 120s of the transaction. and when i got at the login page press go secure to approve the transaction. it repeatly tell me the transaction has expired, when i still have 120s. i did a few more time with the same result till transaction have really expired. ok i give another go, i reinstall the app, reregistered it for 3 more time to do the fpx and it still waste my time
From bad to worse. It was already laggy and slow before. Since the update, takes close to forever to load(my internet is running at 500mbps) . And the interface is very buggy. I can't do any transactions just an endless loop of returning to the home screen. I end up using chrome or my PC for any online transactions. Please this app really needs a major update & revamp. At a time when most things are online you might loose more customers bcoz other app(bank) are better
If there is an option to give 0 star, damn sure I'd give it without hesitation. Every time updates coming this app has become much much worse than before. Please fix your app and your server so we can log in without issue. Fix the damn issue asap or else we will port to another bank.
Half an hour loading to open the apps. Very very very bad apps for such a big finance company. Please let us used the browser instead of this app.. I repeat.. Very.. Very....very very.. Bad and junk apps.
I hate this app ever.... From September until the end of October, this app can't perform well even i have updated it... I can't do anything to my money in the bank. Already made some reports via email and call centre for this issue. Seem like no action from them.
Not intuitive to use. I cancelled my transfer settings and press OK on the dialog option, nothing happened, not even to the homepage. I tap on back button and the app not responding at all. Can't even find ASNB account summary or related (not transaction) but the bank have that service, really not good. Edit: No error, I wrote "Nothing happened" means I got any feedback from that? No, you didn't code any error message. That's even worst.
Unable to login,Already clear and uninstall the app.Still get the same error. There is no more,Go secure for approve transaction purpose.It is very dangerous since no safety in online transaction. YES,this is the latest version of app.
Worst app ever exist! Very slow and u need to activate go secure even for small amount transfer. Waste of time!! Once lag, it's going to lag forever.. in the end, need to uninstall and install it again. No improvement despite people giving reviews. Don't bother to create an app if it's only cause trouble every time u need to use it!!
My rating for this app has plummeted significantly lately among financial apps that I've used. Worst experience and seems buggy, it hangs frequently and randomly unresponsive, not able to connect, etc. Not easy for online payment. Getting tired of all sorts of issue for a financial apps from a Bank. Really needs to buck up and hope security is no compromised though!
Greetings to whom it might concern. You are a bank institution. There supposedly should not be any crashes, trouble opening, and unable to connect to the server every time. Please do something about this. I am so tired of having to close and open the app every time I wanted to do transactions and approvals. Worst, re-installing for dozens of times. Thus, I had trouble making simple payments. I hope to actually use your banking app smoothly. I look foward to see some improvements.
I have no words for how much I hate this app. Recently updated, now my transfer limit can't be changed on the app. It's a different limit from the mobile site, and it's a ridiculously low limit that I can't do anything with. Uninstalling and reinstalling for the umpteenth time and hope (yet again) that this will fix the problem.
Im so proud of bank islam. Most of the time this app cannot work, always loading screen and server error. However, rather than solving this issue you guys have a great idea by making transactions approval using the go app. So if we successfully log into the portal using web browser, we still need to open the app which is 99% does not work. What a fantastic idea! Btw, stop using AI to reply all reviews. Clearing cache wil not solve anything for this garbage system
Please upgrade your apps. Tells me to update, after updating the app, it says cannot connect to the server. Need to uninstall and re-install. Tired of doing the same thing all over again...if i can give u zero star, i would. Worst banking app ever. I don't know how many times already i uninstall and reinstall your app. Don't tell me about phone spec, never encountered this problem on any other banking app. 😤
Worst ever online banking app I've ever experienced. After having to install, uninstall and reinstall, it still failed to function. Doesn't even deserve 1-star. Please buck up!! and emulate other banks' secure app that have been proven to perform, no need to reinvent the wheel, just get it sorted out before imposing on customers to use such app for our online banking transactions.
App not responsive to touch input on landing/login page. Uninstalled and reinstalled still unresponsive, cannot tap 'get started'. Hope can fix soon.
Actually not bad if you compare with other bank software. User friendly UI, Easy to use, just abit slow sometimes. Other all good for me.
After update, cannot connect to the server. Need to uninstall and install it again. Loading time too long when need to do secure pay, untill timeout. Not much improvement compare to other internet banking apps after a year from my last reviewed.
I can see this app is improving. My only complaint is that it would be nice if this app would let guest user login using the app that already has a registered user ID. Sometimes, I'm helping my mom doing online transactions when I was at hostel, so it was troublesome to deregistered my Go bank account just to use Go secure using my mom Go bank account.
the app just updated and now i can't even make it to the login screen because of "server error". it's a pain and i need to use the app for online and cashless transactions, do fix this problem ASAP
too many bugs,slow apps eventhough signal at the area in good condition, need to improve on the apps efficiency,unable to screenshot as a evidence while performing any transaction.
Slow loading apps. Very, very, very, slow loading apps. Not that user friendly. Always had trouble using this apps.
Asked me to update employment status when I tried to login through web browser but need to approve via app. Downloaded the app, but need to enable unnecessary permissions. When enabled, server connection error. Head father you, your mother green.
Loading too long. Sometimes not working. Been using for so long but the problem still the same. Never improve. Difficult when trying to pay with qr code cause need to wait for too long.
I tried to transfer money from using website, it refuses and ask me to use this app. But when I install the app and try to transfer, I keep getting error "You are not allowed to perform this monetary transaction for 12 hours".
At account details page, my money are still there but it keep decreasing at home pages. It's frustrating. I can't make transaction. It keeps saying i don't have balance left
Pure connection. Already update handphone to android 10, but still fail to connect, although after using variety of internet line.
Notice that there is improvement on the application, especially it is much faster than before, which makes QR payment is possible. Keep up the good work.
The newer version app has improved a lot. No more lagging. Easy to log in. Online transfer has been easy. A+ for team effort
Unable to login after newly installed in new phone. Keeps saying connection to server is lost. Please fix. Thank you.
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE fix your app sometimes it will suddenly became error and i need to reinstall it REINSTALL ITT !!! IT'S SO FRUSTRATING !!! BECAUSE I USED THIS APP FOR MY DAILY WHEN I REINSTALL IT AGAIN I NEED TO WAIT 24 HOURS TO DO THE TRANSACTION (24 HOURS 24 HOURS) YOU THINK I HAVE TIME TO WAITTTT. I already read someone chat and i read your reply . You said you already fixed it. But you lying the problem are still not fixed .
Edit Again: Alhamdulillah the app nowadays is usable enough. They get rid of the useless feature that caused the app unusable in the previous version
Now it's unusable. Keep giving me error code 500 (APZ_TSN_500). I did everything I could, reinstall, clear cache and data. Only work for a brief moment after I reinstall / clear data and it doesn't work after I close and try to open the app. For some reason, it works perfectly on my friends phone.
Every single time when I want to use go app , it crashed . Why can't you just like before ? Sending TAC through SMS , it's a lot more easier and after using GO app everything when really bad .
Hi again its me your customer. Recently I try to make a few purchases from tiktok shop but after the first purchase, the system started to go crazy and it can't even able to process my purchase anymore. It unfortunately cancelled out my promo payment hence why I'm rating it 1 star. Please kindly fix this issue.
lousy lousy lousy still..updated oct 2023 . Frustrating lately since up-dating this app recently, always unable to connect. Why give us this trouble now? after many years hassle free without un-install and install. Fix this!!! Nothing being done. Stop replying me the same stupid answer like the others.
I want to pay my uni fee, but I can't pay it through online because it's keep loading. I prefer, the old version where we just need to put code from SMS from need permission from aps. Because this app will stuck. I want to pay my uni fee!!!!
Sorry to say. Very bad and bad system ever. After update the latest one I cannot access my online banking. Always lagging all the time even though using wifi. Waste time waiting & drag my time also.
The apps took tooooo long to open since the update. It hinder all my transfer since it need go secure and the page won't open even the homepage. Please fix it asap
Worst bank app service ever. Low maintenance and really annoying to handle such simple tasks. Buffer all the time and not even a message to inform in the app have problems to be fixed.
Apps Loading time during peak and non peak hours are terrible. If other banks's apps can be efficient in terms of loading time and etc, bank islam should make initiatives to develop an app that is on par with other apps. Show some class 😮‍💨
Your notification was so bad. No information regarding the need to upgrade, uninstall and reinstall. Your sense of urgency is so bad that you not allow customer to perform transaction right after installing the app. Instead, you asked for a cooling off 12 hours? Are you running a beta version on BIMB customer? You made 12 hours of misery.
I cleared app cache and data. Tried again. Its working. Thank you. Just that the tag that comes in into the phone only works at the second attempt.. not the first.
Bad experience, and looks like no improvement even though customers rate low. I think you should test your apps thoroughly. It is still the same even you have upgraded the version. Please be serious on improving your customer experience.
I am using this app since last 3 years. This is so frustrating. The App doesn’t work when you need it the most. I think the developers of this App are too lazy to fix the issues. Going to switch to another bank this week. Bye bye Bank Islam.
cannot use during payday week, most of the time hang during transaction,go apps becomes not go apps..the 1st version way much better than current. What a dissapointed experienced!
Its getting worse..i hope you guys can fix this problem..its already a couple of days but i still can't login to the apps..i always update the apps..but it's doesn't seem to be a changes at all..
Truly disappointed! After so many attempt trying to login with password still invalid! We only able to login with same password and username thru website using chrome browser. Please do something with your crash app!
Very slow. Every day I will uninstall and reinstall back. Than need to wait another 12hrs for transfer. Poor app. Why keep continue such services. Very sorry. Very frustrating.
The worst experience ever in all history of Online Banking app. This app is super slow considering how every user's bank account need verification from this app and yet it took forever to load. Such disappointment
The previous version is much better than now. I can't even log in to do my transaction and there's always error that I getting annoyed now 😑. Please fix it quickly
The latest mandatory update is full of bugs. I can't open it well especially when I need to transfer my money. The previous version is way better.
Please make an improvement to your apps, I'm very frustrated and annoyed each time to make any payments because this apps keep take a long time on loading page before going to login page. Please Bank Islam, do better.
The apps is not workable, lagging and not able to log in all the times, resulting in broken dateline and promises( so not islamic at all). Pls pls do something or do we need to report to PMX as well. It has improved and i m satisfied now
After updating still no improvement. After one transaction succsess, next transaction always failed. Always need to log out and delete cache, then can do the transaction. Becoming worst every year.
Can't login, at first didn't approved access, then as it is compulsory, allowed the access, but get error "Unable to connect to the server" Off, clear cached, still can't get through
i can't log in Go By Bank Islam (it said Invalid Credential) eventhough i updated to the latest version and my device is not old version, i told to the email (contact centre) and no response at all, please fix it ASAP, i need to use the app
Just recently update the app, and now i can't even open it😑 it says can't connect to server. Edited: thank you Bank Islam. I follow ur instruction. I delete my app and install it again. It worked
One of the worst app that I ever downloaded. I used to pay via fpx online but after the new update, I need to get permission from this Go app and sometimes it doesn't even work and after the latest update I can't pay to purchase something online💆‍♂️
Very inconvenient. Unstable and non worked app. Cant even open the app and just keep loading. I want to give negative star for this useless thing. Rework this disappointing thing.
Cannot access Tabung Haji even with latest update. App condition somehow as if it's an app made by a guy who just build their first app. It's bank app so with current performance, it's a disappointment.
Told me to use the app instead of website. But the app cannot even open. So how can I transfer and stuff. So disappointed especially during emergency...
Why does it keep buffering? I'm unable to make any purchases. Help please Latest: I've already updated it. Still the same, is it need a very good internet connection?
Please I'm begging you please update and fix the system..its been down with server error for weeks and this is not the 1st time. Sometimes it takes hours just to load -whattt??
Hi there, what has happened to this app, I can't log in even i tried many time. Previous version has better version than this new version. Please improve this kind of problem.
Unusable. App will stay on the loading page endlessly. Its been going on for months! Update 02/10/2023: Latest updates makes it even worse. Did you guys hire a bunch monkeys to manage this app? Didn't gave them enough bananas?
apsal app ni slow sgt.. Bi kena lebih improve customer service n satisfaction ni.. 4 app yg lain semua jauh lbh lancar. Once account freezed, and it keep repeating wrong password.. and u have to wait for 12 hours to make a transaction, this is nonsense service.. I'll better move to other banks..
Worst mobile apps ever. It didn't work properly and not even able to open it most of the time especially for Android user.
The app some time not available as before . The loading process take a several times. Some time i got fed up with this app. Please make it smooth like your take it money from us.
for many times, i try and try but still cannot login and of course it happens during the most urgent period. worthless apps!
Previous update was better than current. Dont know if there any maintenance, app and web both take more time loading and lag when enter it. Please make good your system
Just wanted to let the devs know that the app was not able to connect to the BIMB server after the latest update. I tried updating, clearing cache, clearing storage and nothing works. It only worked again after reinstalling the app. I loved the app but it will be even more amazing if the GUI is more fluid, though that's just me being picky. Hopefully the next update is smooth as it's been a recurring issue. Kudos to the devs.
Please fix the app. Sometimes it takes time to load, unable to connect to server but when accessing internet banking through the browser works just fine. A few times I had to reinstall the app just to fix the server error. It annoys me because clearing cache doesn't help at all to reset the connection to server. Why is that a problem? Basically the app becomes completely useless when the error starts popping up, reinstalling is the only option. We use this almost daily now.
Previous version apps are more batter than current apps. After I updated to a new apps the apps seems having a bad issues. 1. It is hard to open, and it takes more time to open. Loading too long. 2. Even though1 managed to log in, when I choose, as an example, to transfer a money, the apps will be loaded again, and it takes a long time to load. 3. Not so friendly like before, because when I would like to check other things inside the apps, the same issue happens. Please make changes
NOT USER FRIENDLY AT ALL!!! Last review, 1 star on December 2022, until today Nov 2024, this apps does not improve much. They include fingerprint to make the access easier, but not easy at all. I can easily access to see ny account with 1 time using fingerprint eith other banking apps, but not with this app. To open each section, it loading for so long. To get approval for transaction also take some time. What's the point moving to 5G era, but your app still slow.
for the past week I couldn't get pass the starting screen of the app and thus i can never access the app anymore. i have checked if there's any update but there were none and my phone meets the app requirement system. the web browser works fine but it is frustrating bc i can't use the app anymore to do instant transfers. fix this issue please this is too absurd
The app is so slow, and it will not open at all. I have to uninstall the app and reinstall it every time i want to use the app. After reinstalling, I can only use it once. The second time I try to use it, the same thing happens, and I will have to uninstall again. After reinstalling the app, I can't make any transfers to other banks for the next 12 hours. I feel like closing my account just because of this. This app is not convenient at all. In fact, it is troublesome to the users.
Cannot launch the app. Tried everything and yet the login page never appear, stucked at the front page forever. Read the latest reviews, and the developer keep on telling to update to latest version (3.2.09), which is what everyone already have update to, or use phone with android 9 and above. No solution or whatsover. Very disappointed with how little they care about clients' experience.

I cannot even pay using online banking due to problem service.
PLEASE DO SOMETHING TO THE APPS!! after installed the updated version, it is always loading and stuck at the start up n i cant open the apps. Update on 28 oct 2023, i believe there is no improvement that bank islam done to their apps, which is super non friendly user, lagging, need to open and log in several times, i almost forget my password because rarely use it due to the issues.
Too many errors occuring from time to time Either not being able to log in, not able to use the QR, and even worse, not even able to open the apps even after waiting for quite some time. Had to uninstall then reinstall the app. It is annoying as you need to enter your data all over again
i will close my account because if this incompetent app. now that you force to use app to validate any transfer but it does not even connect. i have clear cache, update, uninstall and reinstall before you even try to ask for me to update this app. even tried with wifi and my mobile 5G speed. this is just pure garbage of an app.
Why i kept getting error "400 bad request", although i already key in my correct password and id also the tac number. After that error, the app send me msg that i already registered yet unable to to log in. Please resolve this, i already uninstall and reinstall for several time.. Dear BIMB, Again this app really needs improvement. As from all customers that seems to have the same issues, we really need you to solves it fast for us to used it again.
Please please please do stg about the app start up, I can't open the app no matter how many times I tried, and since some transcation require verification from this app it's really frustrating! Why in the world does everything need verification from the app anyway, the duitnow I get, the jompay I get, but why funds transfer too????
Too slow, the app keep loading and in the end, the session expired just like that. One more thing... it keeps telling us to UPDATE BUT NOTHING'S CHANGED!! STILL THE SAME PROBLEMS OCCUR WHILE USING THE APP!! Please make improvement on the app so that IT WILL BE EASIER FOR US, THE USER OF THE APP!!
Useless app !  Most of the time take time to load unable to connect to server. It's really frustrating. I had to reinstall the app when I need to do the transaction. Annoying !!!
Sometimes it's working.... sometimes NOT. It continues to buffer. So unfriendly users. In fact my phone is new, install & uninstall 3 times by now & updated the apps to the latest version. But still the SAME prob reoccurring. Fix you apps pls!
the most stupidest banking app.. it will take forever to load. on top of that if you want to perform duitnow transfer through the browser, you still need to open your go app. it's so annoying and it really makes me angry. i have very stable internet connection. Hey bimb please learn from cimb how to operate an app.
i want to carry out fpx transaction. so i need to use go app to approve the transaction. and goes on loading till the last 120s of the transaction. and when i got at the login page press go secure to approve the transaction. it repeatly tell me the transaction has expired, when i still have 120s. i did a few more time with the same result till transaction have really expired. ok i give another go, i reinstall the app, reregistered it for 3 more time to do the fpx and it still waste my time
Very disappointing experience using bank islam go, it takes forever just to get to the log in screen, not to mention the problem while scanning qr codes and many more.. what's the point of yall taking RM 13 from our bank accounts if you didn't do anything to fix the goddamn app..no one will be furious if there is a slight inconvenience for a short period of time, but this app has been giving people nothing but trouble for quite some time..please step up your IT teams

25/8/23: Guess I'm not changing my opinion anytime soon. Very, very rarely it was fast. Rest of the time? So slow that I forgot I have to pay for something. Now? I can't even go to the main page, keeps telling me to reinitiate transaction. WT--?? Like I have no life to live, is it, to wait for the app to actually work?
Greetings to whom it might concern. You are a bank institution. There supposedly should not be any crashes, trouble opening, and unable to connect to the server every time.

Unable to connect the server? Already update the latest version (as of 7 October 2023). Already uninstall and install again to see if it's working, but still doesn't working. If we need to call the center, every user of this app will end up calling Bank Islam. The problem is this app itself.
Not intuitive to use. I cancelled my transfer settings and press OK on the dialog option, nothing happened, not even to the homepage. I tap on back button and the app not responding at all. Can't even find ASNB account summary or related (not transaction) but the bank have that service, really not good. Edit: No error, I wrote "Nothing happened" means I got any feedback from that? No, you didn't code any error message. That's even worst.
Seriously this apps is too slow!! I can't perform a simple money transaction due to the apps just loading itself and I waited for a whole 30 minutes just for the apps to open!!! Even tho it's like that it seems like there's no improvement from the developer to upgrade their application performance... seriously a horrible experience for a cashless person like me.
The app was very very veryyyyyy slowwwwww!!!!!! Couldn't make any transactions with this app. I am beyond disappointed. Edit: after the recent update, there's no more slow loading so i think they deseve more star
Frequently got problem to share the transaction receipt. There are 2 ways to share receipt in GO apps .... thru (menu) history mobile transaction or thru individual account transaction history. Both got blank receipt. My phone OS is Android version 13. GO apps version 3.2.09.

Struggle to access. I had reinstall for 5th time a day. It's very hard to access. Just used website. Please fix the problem. It's make us not happy with this latest version. Actually, time to time, this apps could be easy and friendly to use. Hopefully, please go through for this problem first. This is the major problem from the others. Thank you.
Very bad apps.. Always stuck and nothing happened after wait 10 minutes. Causing me very bad experience to transfer money using western Union and PFX with your apps. Very very very bad!!!!
Took super long to open the apps. Most of the time i gave up. Would rather transfer all my money to other banks, easier when i need to do duitnow payment at the store. Im super close to stop using this app.
Often to unistall and install. Also been waiting for the IAC to be send to my number take years. Requested for so many times still did not received any In case of emergency to do any transaction, this is very much troublesome. Transaction via website also need approval from GO Bimb. How to if I can't even open the apps ?
App not responsive to touch input on landing/login page. Uninstalled and reinstalled still unresponsive, cannot tap 'get started'. Hope can fix soon.
I can see this app is improving. My only complaint is that it would be nice if this app would let guest user login using the app that already has a registered user ID. Sometimes, I'm helping my mom doing online transactions when I was at hostel, so it was troublesome to deregistered my Go bank account just to use Go secure using my mom Go bank account.
Actually not bad if you compare with other bank software. User friendly UI, Easy to use, just abit slow sometimes. Other all good for me.
I mean i understand that many people are using this app, but you have to accommodate good service to them. Make frequent maintenance, if u already did u have to make it even more frequent. Please people are just trying to get their transactions through and if u are wishing to keep them as customers, please improve.
too many bugs,slow apps eventhough signal at the area in good condition, need to improve on the apps efficiency,unable to screenshot as a evidence while performing any transaction.
the apps are so bad, clear cache, etc, still unable to open the apps. Online transactions through the website need approval through GO secure, but nothing can be approved since the apps only trying to load the entire time
If the App fails, at least makes it relinquish hold of the account. Else, one can get stuck not being able to access an account from either web client or mobile, effectively locking one out of his/her own account! Update: Reliability gets worser with every update. Daily transaction limit has mistakenly being changed from the basis of accumulated amount transferred daily to just a single transaction per-day. Might as well just close your account if you rely on mobile banking at this point.
I've already updated to the new version but still couldn't open the app.. I don't know why it cannot connect to the server. I've tried using both wifi and data but still can't open.
Very bad application. server always down. Error communication with server. Lag too long. Application did not have user-friendly. Any update did not change anything but make it worse. For technical issue, always be late and too long for maintenance. Suggestion: please improve your server, make staff trained very well for apps, do some testing apps before release it. If apps always crash, make sure ask opinions from another.
Half an hour loading to open the apps. Very very very bad apps for such a big finance company. Please let us used the browser instead of this app.. I repeat.. Very.. Very....very very.. Bad and junk apps.
Unable to login,Already clear and uninstall the app.Still get the same error. There is no more,Go secure for approve transaction purpose.It is very dangerous since no safety in online transaction. YES,this is the latest version of app.
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE fix your app sometimes it will suddenly became error and i need to reinstall it REINSTALL ITT !!! IT'S SO FRUSTRATING !!! BECAUSE I USED THIS APP FOR MY DAILY WHEN I REINSTALL IT AGAIN I NEED TO WAIT 24 HOURS TO DO THE TRANSACTION (24 HOURS 24 HOURS) YOU THINK I HAVE TIME TO WAITTTT. I already read someone chat and i read your reply . You said you already fixed it. But you lying the problem are still not fixed .
Every single time when I want to use go app , it crashed . Why can't you just like before ? Sending TAC through SMS , it's a lot more easier and after using GO app everything when really bad .
I will be honest. This app is the worst. The loading takes too long for me to open the app. If its only a minute or two is okay but it takes 5 mintues or even more just to load? I've heard the issue is not new which proves this app is just that bad.
I want to pay my uni fee, but I can't pay it through online because it's keep loading. I prefer, the old version where we just need to put code from SMS from need permission from aps. Because this app will stuck. I want to pay my uni fee!!!!
If there is an option to give 0 star, damn sure I'd give it without hesitation. Every time updates coming this app has become much much worse than before. Please fix your app and your server so we can log in without issue. Fix the damn issue asap or else we will port to another bank.
Sorry to say. Very bad and bad system ever. After update the latest one I cannot access my online banking. Always lagging all the time even though using wifi. Waste time waiting & drag my time also.
lousy lousy lousy still..updated oct 2023 . Frustrating lately since up-dating this app recently, always unable to connect. Why give us this trouble now? after many years hassle free without un-install and install. Fix this!!! Nothing being done. Stop replying me the same stupid answer like the others.
I hate this app ever.... From September until the end of October, this app can't perform well even i have updated it... I can't do anything to my money in the bank. Already made some reports via email and call centre for this issue. Seem like no action from them.
The apps took tooooo long to open since the update. It hinder all my transfer since it need go secure and the page won't open even the homepage. Please fix it asap
Please upgrade the apps. Loading time to open the apps is unstable. Sometimes it's working fine, sometime it took forever. Making it hard to perform transaction. Especially, when using Go Secure. I am able to receive notification from other apps while the apps loading for Go Secure. I believed it is not my mobile network problem. Please fix the issue. Online banking apps should be seamless as we are practicing cashless transaction for the norm.
Truly disappointed! After so many attempt trying to login with password still invalid! We only able to login with same password and username thru website using chrome browser. Please do something with your crash app!
the app just updated and now i can't even make it to the login screen because of "server error". it's a pain and i need to use the app for online and cashless transactions, do fix this problem ASAP
I have no words for how much I hate this app. Recently updated, now my transfer limit can't be changed on the app. It's a different limit from the mobile site, and it's a ridiculously low limit that I can't do anything with. Uninstalling and reinstalling for the umpteenth time and hope (yet again) that this will fix the problem.
Your notification was so bad. No information regarding the need to upgrade, uninstall and reinstall. Your sense of urgency is so bad that you not allow customer to perform transaction right after installing the app. Instead, you asked for a cooling off 12 hours? Are you running a beta version on BIMB customer? You made 12 hours of misery.
Srsly, this system must be improved. I am thinking bout changing my service bcs of this. A simple transaction bcome complicated as h*ll. Byk sgt maintanance. Yeah, a system should be frequently maintaned but the frequency of this app being maintance is just too much and sometimes so abrupt .it bother the urgent transaction. Not only that,the application has tons of problem. Slow.
cannot use during payday week, most of the time hang during transaction,go apps becomes not go apps..the 1st version way much better than current. What a dissapointed experienced!
The worst online banking app. It took so long to just open the app. It will just keep on loading I need to wait for a very long time for the app to literally open for me to do my payment. I need to open the app super early if I want to use the app. There's no nice experience for me while using this app. I really hope that your technology/it team could rework or do something to make the app run smoothly. People has been talking about this problem since forever and I can't see any improvements.
Its getting worse..i hope you guys can fix this problem..its already a couple of days but i still can't login to the apps..i always update the apps..but it's doesn't seem to be a changes at all..
This has to be the worst apps for a bank. You cannot even access and the page rotates like drops of blood oozing and oozing. Even using the website, as payment has to be made, when it transfers to the apps, the apps does not respond promptly until you have delayed payment in your waiting list. Unfortunately, has to be cancelled and switch to another bank service. This has to be the worst nightmare for Bank Islam customers. I would rate this apps zero star for incompetence, slow & irresponsive.
Worst bank app service ever. Low maintenance and really annoying to handle such simple tasks. Buffer all the time and not even a message to inform in the app have problems to be fixed.
Very frequent system hang. Then I will have to uninstall and reinstall back. Pls improve system reliability and stability. Tq 23 June 2023 Still no improvement with the apps. I still have to uninstall and re install every single time I want to access the Go apps. Worse now it says I can only do transaction 12 hours after! 3rd time already. And you can guess when I try to login after 12 hrs, the apps will just flicker forever and I have to again uninstall and reinstall back. Pls revamp the app.
After update, cannot connect to the server. Need to uninstall and install it again. Loading time too long when need to do secure pay, untill timeout. Not much improvement compare to other internet banking apps after a year from my last reviewed.
Worst ever online banking app I've ever experienced. After having to install, uninstall and reinstall, it still failed to function. Doesn't even deserve 1-star. Please buck up!! and emulate other banks' secure app that have been proven to perform, no need to reinvent the wheel, just get it sorted out before imposing on customers to use such app for our online banking transactions.
Apps Loading time during peak and non peak hours are terrible. If other banks's apps can be efficient in terms of loading time and etc, bank islam should make initiatives to develop an app that is on par with other apps. Show some class 😮‍💨
Please upgrade your apps. Tells me to update, after updating the app, it says cannot connect to the server. Need to uninstall and re-install. Tired of doing the same thing all over again...if i can give u zero star, i would. Worst banking app ever. I don't know how many times already i uninstall and reinstall your app. Don't tell me about phone spec, never encountered this problem on any other banking app. 😤
Now it's unusable. Keep giving me error code 500 (APZ_TSN_500). I did everything I could, reinstall, clear cache and data. Only work for a brief moment after I reinstall / clear data and it doesn't work after I close and try to open the app. For some reason, it works perfectly on my friends phone.
Hi again its me your customer. Recently I try to make a few purchases from tiktok shop but after the first purchase, the system started to go crazy and it can't even able to process my purchase anymore. It unfortunately cancelled out my promo payment hence why I'm rating it 1 star. Please kindly fix this issue.
I've had quite a frustrating experience with this app. Picture this: you're in the process of confirming a purchase, and you're given just one minute to do so. However, the app takes an eternity to load, and when the time finally runs out, all the items in your cart disappear, forcing you to start the search all over again. It's a situation that leaves me truly disappointed, and I believe Bank Islam should take this feedback seriously. What a shame.
I want to open the app, it takes a long time to load..then I want to transfer money, it loads again..then it is denied.. after that i must to delete the app, then download it again.. open the app, it loads again, then it is denied and I have to wait 12 hours to make the transfer.. the same thing happens over and over again.. please do something & improve your services..
Not a good option if you want to use this apps as your main account. It takes forever to load for login. I have uninstall and reinstall again. Still the same problem. Better to have another account which has more user friendly mobile apps like MAE or CIMB. Today 20/9/23 still same problem. These comments mean nothing perhaps.
Current version not user friendly. Always have an issue when try to log in and take time to load. The apps keep down whenever we try to open. Please help to fix this. Very difficult for a user to use the apps.
The app is slow because it needs a strong Internet connection. That's all. Suggestion: 1. Update the UI app to more fresh one following the trend right now (Be U can, why the official app cannot right?) 2. Make a more friendly user UI, not old school one, bold & not interesting UI.
I would give 0.5 star only If I can. This app so worse and complicated to use. It's very sensitive about the security maybe and always got some problem, trouble, issue etc and ask us to go to bank, email the bank or call bank to fix it. Other bank is better because it's easy to use unlike this app. Always give us problem even though we use it politely
I usually use mobile browser to make transfer in Bank Islam. But now you put another filter as in to approve transaction in this GO app. It's good on paper, because another security authentication is always good, BUT THIS GO APP IS ALWAYS UNRESPONSIVE. Imagine a simple transfer takes nearly an hour just to be responsive. Shame on you. It's 2023 but this app likes like it was build in 90s. And NO! I will not reach you at the email given. Step up your game or you'll lose many more users like me.
At account details page, my money are still there but it keep decreasing at home pages. It's frustrating. I can't make transaction. It keeps saying i don't have balance left
Slow loading apps. Very, very, very, slow loading apps. Not that user friendly. Always had trouble using this apps.
Pure connection. Already update handphone to android 10, but still fail to connect, although after using variety of internet line.
Loading too long. Sometimes not working. Been using for so long but the problem still the same. Never improve. Difficult when trying to pay with qr code cause need to wait for too long.
Asked me to update employment status when I tried to login through web browser but need to approve via app. Downloaded the app, but need to enable unnecessary permissions. When enabled, server connection error. Head father you, your mother green.
I tried to transfer money from using website, it refuses and ask me to use this app. But when I install the app and try to transfer, I keep getting error "You are not allowed to perform this monetary transaction for 12 hours".
The newer version app has improved a lot. No more lagging. Easy to log in. Online transfer has been easy. A+ for team effort
29th Jan 2022: GO apps keep loading for quite some time. I've updated my password and even try to reinstall it. But still the issue doesn't resolved. I've been calling customer service/support to identify what's the root cause. Can anyone from IT team able to solve it? 26th June 2023: It getting worse. Seriously it getting worse. Loading time, response time after key in password, transferring money as well (during OTP seems faster), now approving via Apps took a lot of time. Really frustrating
Unable to login after newly installed in new phone. Keeps saying connection to server is lost. Please fix. Thank you.
I cleared app cache and data. Tried again. Its working. Thank you. Just that the tag that comes in into the phone only works at the second attempt.. not the first.
Edit Again: Alhamdulillah the app nowadays is usable enough. They get rid of the useless feature that caused the app unusable in the previous version
Notice that there is improvement on the application, especially it is much faster than before, which makes QR payment is possible. Keep up the good work.
Transfer all my money to bimb because i lost my Maybank card. Now i cannot do any online transaction due to this app keep on loading till kiamat. Damn very sucks. Why need approval from this app when your system very bad. Nak beli makanan pon cannot pay using qr pay
Please upgrade you apps. Very slow. Unable to do transaction especially paying bill etc.. Thinking to migrade to other bank if no action taken to solve the problem
Simple, yet full of features. Unfortunately, not 5-star as it's sometimes difficult to access.
I love the app although they have problem loading quite a lot. I use it mainly because i connect it to the tabung haji. But i cant do it anymore. Why is that?
Deserves no star. Time is of the essence when it comes to financial transactions, but with this app constantly crashing, it defeats the whole purpose of having an app for financial transaction. Don't introduce an app if it cannot serve it's purpose. What is the point of me having to approve online banking transaction on the go app if the go pp constantly crashes??? No transaction can go through? Just stick to the code being sent to your phone???
Very slow. Every day I will uninstall and reinstall back. Than need to wait another 12hrs for transfer. Poor app. Why keep continue such services. Very sorry. Very frustrating.
Unable to open the app. The app keeps loading for 5mins+. Cannot do any online transaction within the app.
Dear admin, please fix your bugs in this app ASAP. The latest update makes everything worse. I can't even open the app, and I can't even transfer online banking at all. If the app isn't gonna get fixed, it's hard for the users to proceed online transaction. I've tried uninstalled the app and reinstall it back but still the same. So pls fix the bug as soon as possible.
Just wanted to let the devs know that the app was not able to connect to the BIMB server after the latest update. I tried updating, clearing cache, clearing storage and nothing works. It only worked again after reinstalling the app. I loved the app but it will be even more amazing if the GUI is more fluid, though that's just me being picky. Hopefully the next update is smooth as it's been a recurring issue. Kudos to the devs.
Please fix the app. Sometimes it takes time to load, unable to connect to server but when accessing internet banking through the browser works just fine. A few times I had to reinstall the app just to fix the server error. It annoys me because clearing cache doesn't help at all to reset the connection to server. Why is that a problem? Basically the app becomes completely useless when the error starts popping up, reinstalling is the only option. We use this almost daily now.
Previous version apps are more batter than current apps. After I updated to a new apps the apps seems having a bad issues. 1. It is hard to open, and it takes more time to open. Loading too long. 2. Even though1 managed to log in, when I choose, as an example, to transfer a money, the apps will be loaded again, and it takes a long time to load. 3. Not so friendly like before, because when I would like to check other things inside the apps, the same issue happens. Please make changes

I cannot even pay using online banking due to problem service.
NOT USER FRIENDLY AT ALL!!! Last review, 1 star on December 2022, until today Nov 2024, this apps does not improve much. They include fingerprint to make the access easier, but not easy at all. I can easily access to see ny account with 1 time using fingerprint eith other banking apps, but not with this app. To open each section, it loading for so long. To get approval for transaction also take some time. What's the point moving to 5G era, but your app still slow.
for the past week I couldn't get pass the starting screen of the app and thus i can never access the app anymore. i have checked if there's any update but there were none and my phone meets the app requirement system. the web browser works fine but it is frustrating bc i can't use the app anymore to do instant transfers. fix this issue please this is too absurd
Cannot launch the app. Tried everything and yet the login page never appear, stucked at the front page forever. Read the latest reviews, and the developer keep on telling to update to latest version (3.2.09), which is what everyone already have update to, or use phone with android 9 and above. No solution or whatsover. Very disappointed with how little they care about clients' experience.
The app is so slow, and it will not open at all. I have to uninstall the app and reinstall it every time i want to use the app. After reinstalling, I can only use it once. The second time I try to use it, the same thing happens, and I will have to uninstall again. After reinstalling the app, I can't make any transfers to other banks for the next 12 hours. I feel like closing my account just because of this. This app is not convenient at all. In fact, it is troublesome to the users.
Too many errors occuring from time to time Either not being able to log in, not able to use the QR, and even worse, not even able to open the apps even after waiting for quite some time. Had to uninstall then reinstall the app. It is annoying as you need to enter your data all over again
PLEASE DO SOMETHING TO THE APPS!! after installed the updated version, it is always loading and stuck at the start up n i cant open the apps. Update on 28 oct 2023, i believe there is no improvement that bank islam done to their apps, which is super non friendly user, lagging, need to open and log in several times, i almost forget my password because rarely use it due to the issues.

Useless app !  Most of the time take time to load unable to connect to server. It's really frustrating. I had to reinstall the app when I need to do the transaction. Annoying !!!
i will close my account because if this incompetent app. now that you force to use app to validate any transfer but it does not even connect. i have clear cache, update, uninstall and reinstall before you even try to ask for me to update this app. even tried with wifi and my mobile 5G speed. this is just pure garbage of an app.
25/8/23: Guess I'm not changing my opinion anytime soon. Very, very rarely it was fast. Rest of the time? So slow that I forgot I have to pay for something. Now? I can't even go to the main page, keeps telling me to reinitiate transaction. WT--?? Like I have no life to live, is it, to wait for the app to actually work?
the most stupidest banking app.. it will take forever to load. on top of that if you want to perform duitnow transfer through the browser, you still need to open your go app. it's so annoying and it really makes me angry. i have very stable internet connection. Hey bimb please learn from cimb how to operate an app.
Unable to connect the server? Already update the latest version (as of 7 October 2023). Already uninstall and install again to see if it's working, but still doesn't working. If we need to call the center, every user of this app will end up calling Bank Islam. The problem is this app itself.
Very disappointing experience using bank islam go, it takes forever just to get to the log in screen, not to mention the problem while scanning qr codes and many more.. what's the point of yall taking RM 13 from our bank accounts if you didn't do anything to fix the goddamn app..no one will be furious if there is a slight inconvenience for a short period of time, but this app has been giving people nothing but trouble for quite some time..please step up your IT teams
Why i kept getting error "400 bad request", although i already key in my correct password and id also the tac number. After that error, the app send me msg that i already registered yet unable to to log in. Please resolve this, i already uninstall and reinstall for several time.. Dear BIMB, Again this app really needs improvement. As from all customers that seems to have the same issues, we really need you to solves it fast for us to used it again.
Please please please do stg about the app start up, I can't open the app no matter how many times I tried, and since some transcation require verification from this app it's really frustrating! Why in the world does everything need verification from the app anyway, the duitnow I get, the jompay I get, but why funds transfer too????
Sometimes it's working.... sometimes NOT. It continues to buffer. So unfriendly users. In fact my phone is new, install & uninstall 3 times by now & updated the apps to the latest version. But still the SAME prob reoccurring. Fix you apps pls!
Too slow, the app keep loading and in the end, the session expired just like that. One more thing... it keeps telling us to UPDATE BUT NOTHING'S CHANGED!! STILL THE SAME PROBLEMS OCCUR WHILE USING THE APP!! Please make improvement on the app so that IT WILL BE EASIER FOR US, THE USER OF THE APP!!
Often to unistall and install. Also been waiting for the IAC to be send to my number take years. Requested for so many times still did not received any In case of emergency to do any transaction, this is very much troublesome. Transaction via website also need approval from GO Bimb. How to if I can't even open the apps ?
I will be honest. This app is the worst. The loading takes too long for me to open the app. If its only a minute or two is okay but it takes 5 mintues or even more just to load? I've heard the issue is not new which proves this app is just that bad.
I've already updated to the new version but still couldn't open the app.. I don't know why it cannot connect to the server. I've tried using both wifi and data but still can't open.
Very bad apps.. Always stuck and nothing happened after wait 10 minutes. Causing me very bad experience to transfer money using western Union and PFX with your apps. Very very very bad!!!!
the apps are so bad, clear cache, etc, still unable to open the apps. Online transactions through the website need approval through GO secure, but nothing can be approved since the apps only trying to load the entire time
Took super long to open the apps. Most of the time i gave up. Would rather transfer all my money to other banks, easier when i need to do duitnow payment at the store. Im super close to stop using this app.
I mean i understand that many people are using this app, but you have to accommodate good service to them. Make frequent maintenance, if u already did u have to make it even more frequent. Please people are just trying to get their transactions through and if u are wishing to keep them as customers, please improve.
Frequently got problem to share the transaction receipt. There are 2 ways to share receipt in GO apps .... thru (menu) history mobile transaction or thru individual account transaction history. Both got blank receipt. My phone OS is Android version 13. GO apps version 3.2.09.
The app was very very veryyyyyy slowwwwww!!!!!! Couldn't make any transactions with this app. I am beyond disappointed. Edit: after the recent update, there's no more slow loading so i think they deseve more star
i want to carry out fpx transaction. so i need to use go app to approve the transaction. and goes on loading till the last 120s of the transaction. and when i got at the login page press go secure to approve the transaction. it repeatly tell me the transaction has expired, when i still have 120s. i did a few more time with the same result till transaction have really expired. ok i give another go, i reinstall the app, reregistered it for 3 more time to do the fpx and it still waste my time
From bad to worse. It was already laggy and slow before. Since the update, takes close to forever to load(my internet is running at 500mbps) . And the interface is very buggy. I can't do any transactions just an endless loop of returning to the home screen. I end up using chrome or my PC for any online transactions. Please this app really needs a major update & revamp. At a time when most things are online you might loose more customers bcoz other app(bank) are better
If there is an option to give 0 star, damn sure I'd give it without hesitation. Every time updates coming this app has become much much worse than before. Please fix your app and your server so we can log in without issue. Fix the damn issue asap or else we will port to another bank.
Half an hour loading to open the apps. Very very very bad apps for such a big finance company. Please let us used the browser instead of this app.. I repeat.. Very.. Very....very very.. Bad and junk apps.
I hate this app ever.... From September until the end of October, this app can't perform well even i have updated it... I can't do anything to my money in the bank. Already made some reports via email and call centre for this issue. Seem like no action from them.
Not intuitive to use. I cancelled my transfer settings and press OK on the dialog option, nothing happened, not even to the homepage. I tap on back button and the app not responding at all. Can't even find ASNB account summary or related (not transaction) but the bank have that service, really not good. Edit: No error, I wrote "Nothing happened" means I got any feedback from that? No, you didn't code any error message. That's even worst.
Unable to login,Already clear and uninstall the app.Still get the same error. There is no more,Go secure for approve transaction purpose.It is very dangerous since no safety in online transaction. YES,this is the latest version of app.
Worst app ever exist! Very slow and u need to activate go secure even for small amount transfer. Waste of time!! Once lag, it's going to lag forever.. in the end, need to uninstall and install it again. No improvement despite people giving reviews. Don't bother to create an app if it's only cause trouble every time u need to use it!!
My rating for this app has plummeted significantly lately among financial apps that I've used. Worst experience and seems buggy, it hangs frequently and randomly unresponsive, not able to connect, etc. Not easy for online payment. Getting tired of all sorts of issue for a financial apps from a Bank. Really needs to buck up and hope security is no compromised though!
Greetings to whom it might concern. You are a bank institution. There supposedly should not be any crashes, trouble opening, and unable to connect to the server every time. Please do something about this. I am so tired of having to close and open the app every time I wanted to do transactions and approvals. Worst, re-installing for dozens of times. Thus, I had trouble making simple payments. I hope to actually use your banking app smoothly. I look foward to see some improvements.
I have no words for how much I hate this app. Recently updated, now my transfer limit can't be changed on the app. It's a different limit from the mobile site, and it's a ridiculously low limit that I can't do anything with. Uninstalling and reinstalling for the umpteenth time and hope (yet again) that this will fix the problem.
Im so proud of bank islam. Most of the time this app cannot work, always loading screen and server error. However, rather than solving this issue you guys have a great idea by making transactions approval using the go app. So if we successfully log into the portal using web browser, we still need to open the app which is 99% does not work. What a fantastic idea! Btw, stop using AI to reply all reviews. Clearing cache wil not solve anything for this garbage system
Please upgrade your apps. Tells me to update, after updating the app, it says cannot connect to the server. Need to uninstall and re-install. Tired of doing the same thing all over again...if i can give u zero star, i would. Worst banking app ever. I don't know how many times already i uninstall and reinstall your app. Don't tell me about phone spec, never encountered this problem on any other banking app. 😤
Worst ever online banking app I've ever experienced. After having to install, uninstall and reinstall, it still failed to function. Doesn't even deserve 1-star. Please buck up!! and emulate other banks' secure app that have been proven to perform, no need to reinvent the wheel, just get it sorted out before imposing on customers to use such app for our online banking transactions.
App not responsive to touch input on landing/login page. Uninstalled and reinstalled still unresponsive, cannot tap 'get started'. Hope can fix soon.
Actually not bad if you compare with other bank software. User friendly UI, Easy to use, just abit slow sometimes. Other all good for me.
After update, cannot connect to the server. Need to uninstall and install it again. Loading time too long when need to do secure pay, untill timeout. Not much improvement compare to other internet banking apps after a year from my last reviewed.
I can see this app is improving. My only complaint is that it would be nice if this app would let guest user login using the app that already has a registered user ID. Sometimes, I'm helping my mom doing online transactions when I was at hostel, so it was troublesome to deregistered my Go bank account just to use Go secure using my mom Go bank account.
the app just updated and now i can't even make it to the login screen because of "server error". it's a pain and i need to use the app for online and cashless transactions, do fix this problem ASAP
too many bugs,slow apps eventhough signal at the area in good condition, need to improve on the apps efficiency,unable to screenshot as a evidence while performing any transaction.
Slow loading apps. Very, very, very, slow loading apps. Not that user friendly. Always had trouble using this apps.
Asked me to update employment status when I tried to login through web browser but need to approve via app. Downloaded the app, but need to enable unnecessary permissions. When enabled, server connection error. Head father you, your mother green.
Loading too long. Sometimes not working. Been using for so long but the problem still the same. Never improve. Difficult when trying to pay with qr code cause need to wait for too long.
I tried to transfer money from using website, it refuses and ask me to use this app. But when I install the app and try to transfer, I keep getting error "You are not allowed to perform this monetary transaction for 12 hours".
At account details page, my money are still there but it keep decreasing at home pages. It's frustrating. I can't make transaction. It keeps saying i don't have balance left
Pure connection. Already update handphone to android 10, but still fail to connect, although after using variety of internet line.
Notice that there is improvement on the application, especially it is much faster than before, which makes QR payment is possible. Keep up the good work.
The newer version app has improved a lot. No more lagging. Easy to log in. Online transfer has been easy. A+ for team effort
Unable to login after newly installed in new phone. Keeps saying connection to server is lost. Please fix. Thank you.
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE fix your app sometimes it will suddenly became error and i need to reinstall it REINSTALL ITT !!! IT'S SO FRUSTRATING !!! BECAUSE I USED THIS APP FOR MY DAILY WHEN I REINSTALL IT AGAIN I NEED TO WAIT 24 HOURS TO DO THE TRANSACTION (24 HOURS 24 HOURS) YOU THINK I HAVE TIME TO WAITTTT. I already read someone chat and i read your reply . You said you already fixed it. But you lying the problem are still not fixed .
Edit Again: Alhamdulillah the app nowadays is usable enough. They get rid of the useless feature that caused the app unusable in the previous version
Now it's unusable. Keep giving me error code 500 (APZ_TSN_500). I did everything I could, reinstall, clear cache and data. Only work for a brief moment after I reinstall / clear data and it doesn't work after I close and try to open the app. For some reason, it works perfectly on my friends phone.
Every single time when I want to use go app , it crashed . Why can't you just like before ? Sending TAC through SMS , it's a lot more easier and after using GO app everything when really bad .
Hi again its me your customer. Recently I try to make a few purchases from tiktok shop but after the first purchase, the system started to go crazy and it can't even able to process my purchase anymore. It unfortunately cancelled out my promo payment hence why I'm rating it 1 star. Please kindly fix this issue.
lousy lousy lousy still..updated oct 2023 . Frustrating lately since up-dating this app recently, always unable to connect. Why give us this trouble now? after many years hassle free without un-install and install. Fix this!!! Nothing being done. Stop replying me the same stupid answer like the others.
I want to pay my uni fee, but I can't pay it through online because it's keep loading. I prefer, the old version where we just need to put code from SMS from need permission from aps. Because this app will stuck. I want to pay my uni fee!!!!
Sorry to say. Very bad and bad system ever. After update the latest one I cannot access my online banking. Always lagging all the time even though using wifi. Waste time waiting & drag my time also.
The apps took tooooo long to open since the update. It hinder all my transfer since it need go secure and the page won't open even the homepage. Please fix it asap
Worst bank app service ever. Low maintenance and really annoying to handle such simple tasks. Buffer all the time and not even a message to inform in the app have problems to be fixed.
Apps Loading time during peak and non peak hours are terrible. If other banks's apps can be efficient in terms of loading time and etc, bank islam should make initiatives to develop an app that is on par with other apps. Show some class 😮‍💨
Your notification was so bad. No information regarding the need to upgrade, uninstall and reinstall. Your sense of urgency is so bad that you not allow customer to perform transaction right after installing the app. Instead, you asked for a cooling off 12 hours? Are you running a beta version on BIMB customer? You made 12 hours of misery.
I cleared app cache and data. Tried again. Its working. Thank you. Just that the tag that comes in into the phone only works at the second attempt.. not the first.
Bad experience, and looks like no improvement even though customers rate low. I think you should test your apps thoroughly. It is still the same even you have upgraded the version. Please be serious on improving your customer experience.
I am using this app since last 3 years. This is so frustrating. The App doesn’t work when you need it the most. I think the developers of this App are too lazy to fix the issues. Going to switch to another bank this week. Bye bye Bank Islam.
cannot use during payday week, most of the time hang during transaction,go apps becomes not go apps..the 1st version way much better than current. What a dissapointed experienced!
Its getting worse..i hope you guys can fix this problem..its already a couple of days but i still can't login to the apps..i always update the apps..but it's doesn't seem to be a changes at all..
Truly disappointed! After so many attempt trying to login with password still invalid! We only able to login with same password and username thru website using chrome browser. Please do something with your crash app!
Very slow. Every day I will uninstall and reinstall back. Than need to wait another 12hrs for transfer. Poor app. Why keep continue such services. Very sorry. Very frustrating.
The worst experience ever in all history of Online Banking app. This app is super slow considering how every user's bank account need verification from this app and yet it took forever to load. Such disappointment
The previous version is much better than now. I can't even log in to do my transaction and there's always error that I getting annoyed now 😑. Please fix it quickly
The latest mandatory update is full of bugs. I can't open it well especially when I need to transfer my money. The previous version is way better.
Please make an improvement to your apps, I'm very frustrated and annoyed each time to make any payments because this apps keep take a long time on loading page before going to login page. Please Bank Islam, do better.
The apps is not workable, lagging and not able to log in all the times, resulting in broken dateline and promises( so not islamic at all). Pls pls do something or do we need to report to PMX as well. It has improved and i m satisfied now
After updating still no improvement. After one transaction succsess, next transaction always failed. Always need to log out and delete cache, then can do the transaction. Becoming worst every year.
Can't login, at first didn't approved access, then as it is compulsory, allowed the access, but get error "Unable to connect to the server" Off, clear cached, still can't get through
i can't log in Go By Bank Islam (it said Invalid Credential) eventhough i updated to the latest version and my device is not old version, i told to the email (contact centre) and no response at all, please fix it ASAP, i need to use the app
Just recently update the app, and now i can't even open it😑 it says can't connect to server. Edited: thank you Bank Islam. I follow ur instruction. I delete my app and install it again. It worked
One of the worst app that I ever downloaded. I used to pay via fpx online but after the new update, I need to get permission from this Go app and sometimes it doesn't even work and after the latest update I can't pay to purchase something online💆‍♂️
Very inconvenient. Unstable and non worked app. Cant even open the app and just keep loading. I want to give negative star for this useless thing. Rework this disappointing thing.
Cannot access Tabung Haji even with latest update. App condition somehow as if it's an app made by a guy who just build their first app. It's bank app so with current performance, it's a disappointment.
Told me to use the app instead of website. But the app cannot even open. So how can I transfer and stuff. So disappointed especially during emergency...
Why does it keep buffering? I'm unable to make any purchases. Help please Latest: I've already updated it. Still the same, is it need a very good internet connection?
Please I'm begging you please update and fix the system..its been down with server error for weeks and this is not the 1st time. Sometimes it takes hours just to load -whattt??
Hi there, what has happened to this app, I can't log in even i tried many time. Previous version has better version than this new version. Please improve this kind of problem.
Unusable. App will stay on the loading page endlessly. Its been going on for months! Update 02/10/2023: Latest updates makes it even worse. Did you guys hire a bunch monkeys to manage this app? Didn't gave them enough bananas?
apsal app ni slow sgt.. Bi kena lebih improve customer service n satisfaction ni.. 4 app yg lain semua jauh lbh lancar. Once account freezed, and it keep repeating wrong password.. and u have to wait for 12 hours to make a transaction, this is nonsense service.. I'll better move to other banks..
Worst mobile apps ever. It didn't work properly and not even able to open it most of the time especially for Android user.
The app some time not available as before . The loading process take a several times. Some time i got fed up with this app. Please make it smooth like your take it money from us.
for many times, i try and try but still cannot login and of course it happens during the most urgent period. worthless apps!
Previous update was better than current. Dont know if there any maintenance, app and web both take more time loading and lag when enter it. Please make good your system
Just wanted to let the devs know that the app was not able to connect to the BIMB server after the latest update. I tried updating, clearing cache, clearing storage and nothing works. It only worked again after reinstalling the app. I loved the app but it will be even more amazing if the GUI is more fluid, though that's just me being picky. Hopefully the next update is smooth as it's been a recurring issue. Kudos to the devs.
Please fix the app. Sometimes it takes time to load, unable to connect to server but when accessing internet banking through the browser works just fine. A few times I had to reinstall the app just to fix the server error. It annoys me because clearing cache doesn't help at all to reset the connection to server. Why is that a problem? Basically the app becomes completely useless when the error starts popping up, reinstalling is the only option. We use this almost daily now.
Previous version apps are more batter than current apps. After I updated to a new apps the apps seems having a bad issues. 1. It is hard to open, and it takes more time to open. Loading too long. 2. Even though1 managed to log in, when I choose, as an example, to transfer a money, the apps will be loaded again, and it takes a long time to load. 3. Not so friendly like before, because when I would like to check other things inside the apps, the same issue happens. Please make changes

I cannot even pay using online banking due to problem service.
NOT USER FRIENDLY AT ALL!!! Last review, 1 star on December 2022, until today Nov 2024, this apps does not improve much. They include fingerprint to make the access easier, but not easy at all. I can easily access to see ny account with 1 time using fingerprint eith other banking apps, but not with this app. To open each section, it loading for so long. To get approval for transaction also take some time. What's the point moving to 5G era, but your app still slow.
for the past week I couldn't get pass the starting screen of the app and thus i can never access the app anymore. i have checked if there's any update but there were none and my phone meets the app requirement system. the web browser works fine but it is frustrating bc i can't use the app anymore to do instant transfers. fix this issue please this is too absurd
Cannot launch the app. Tried everything and yet the login page never appear, stucked at the front page forever. Read the latest reviews, and the developer keep on telling to update to latest version (3.2.09), which is what everyone already have update to, or use phone with android 9 and above. No solution or whatsover. Very disappointed with how little they care about clients' experience.
The app is so slow, and it will not open at all. I have to uninstall the app and reinstall it every time i want to use the app. After reinstalling, I can only use it once. The second time I try to use it, the same thing happens, and I will have to uninstall again. After reinstalling the app, I can't make any transfers to other banks for the next 12 hours. I feel like closing my account just because of this. This app is not convenient at all. In fact, it is troublesome to the users.
Too many errors occuring from time to time Either not being able to log in, not able to use the QR, and even worse, not even able to open the apps even after waiting for quite some time. Had to uninstall then reinstall the app. It is annoying as you need to enter your data all over again
PLEASE DO SOMETHING TO THE APPS!! after installed the updated version, it is always loading and stuck at the start up n i cant open the apps. Update on 28 oct 2023, i believe there is no improvement that bank islam done to their apps, which is super non friendly user, lagging, need to open and log in several times, i almost forget my password because rarely use it due to the issues.

Useless app !  Most of the time take time to load unable to connect to server. It's really frustrating. I had to reinstall the app when I need to do the transaction. Annoying !!!
i will close my account because if this incompetent app. now that you force to use app to validate any transfer but it does not even connect. i have clear cache, update, uninstall and reinstall before you even try to ask for me to update this app. even tried with wifi and my mobile 5G speed. this is just pure garbage of an app.
25/8/23: Guess I'm not changing my opinion anytime soon. Very, very rarely it was fast. Rest of the time? So slow that I forgot I have to pay for something. Now? I can't even go to the main page, keeps telling me to reinitiate transaction. WT--?? Like I have no life to live, is it, to wait for the app to actually work?
the most stupidest banking app.. it will take forever to load. on top of that if you want to perform duitnow transfer through the browser, you still need to open your go app. it's so annoying and it really makes me angry. i have very stable internet connection. Hey bimb please learn from cimb how to operate an app.
Unable to connect the server? Already update the latest version (as of 7 October 2023). Already uninstall and install again to see if it's working, but still doesn't working. If we need to call the center, every user of this app will end up calling Bank Islam. The problem is this app itself.
Very disappointing experience using bank islam go, it takes forever just to get to the log in screen, not to mention the problem while scanning qr codes and many more.. what's the point of yall taking RM 13 from our bank accounts if you didn't do anything to fix the goddamn app..no one will be furious if there is a slight inconvenience for a short period of time, but this app has been giving people nothing but trouble for quite some time..please step up your IT teams
Why i kept getting error "400 bad request", although i already key in my correct password and id also the tac number. After that error, the app send me msg that i already registered yet unable to to log in. Please resolve this, i already uninstall and reinstall for several time.. Dear BIMB, Again this app really needs improvement. As from all customers that seems to have the same issues, we really need you to solves it fast for us to used it again.
Please please please do stg about the app start up, I can't open the app no matter how many times I tried, and since some transcation require verification from this app it's really frustrating! Why in the world does everything need verification from the app anyway, the duitnow I get, the jompay I get, but why funds transfer too????
Sometimes it's working.... sometimes NOT. It continues to buffer. So unfriendly users. In fact my phone is new, install & uninstall 3 times by now & updated the apps to the latest version. But still the SAME prob reoccurring. Fix you apps pls!
Too slow, the app keep loading and in the end, the session expired just like that. One more thing... it keeps telling us to UPDATE BUT NOTHING'S CHANGED!! STILL THE SAME PROBLEMS OCCUR WHILE USING THE APP!! Please make improvement on the app so that IT WILL BE EASIER FOR US, THE USER OF THE APP!!
Often to unistall and install. Also been waiting for the IAC to be send to my number take years. Requested for so many times still did not received any In case of emergency to do any transaction, this is very much troublesome. Transaction via website also need approval from GO Bimb. How to if I can't even open the apps ?
I will be honest. This app is the worst. The loading takes too long for me to open the app. If its only a minute or two is okay but it takes 5 mintues or even more just to load? I've heard the issue is not new which proves this app is just that bad.
I've already updated to the new version but still couldn't open the app.. I don't know why it cannot connect to the server. I've tried using both wifi and data but still can't open.
Very bad apps.. Always stuck and nothing happened after wait 10 minutes. Causing me very bad experience to transfer money using western Union and PFX with your apps. Very very very bad!!!!
the apps are so bad, clear cache, etc, still unable to open the apps. Online transactions through the website need approval through GO secure, but nothing can be approved since the apps only trying to load the entire time
Took super long to open the apps. Most of the time i gave up. Would rather transfer all my money to other banks, easier when i need to do duitnow payment at the store. Im super close to stop using this app.
I mean i understand that many people are using this app, but you have to accommodate good service to them. Make frequent maintenance, if u already did u have to make it even more frequent. Please people are just trying to get their transactions through and if u are wishing to keep them as customers, please improve.
Frequently got problem to share the transaction receipt. There are 2 ways to share receipt in GO apps .... thru (menu) history mobile transaction or thru individual account transaction history. Both got blank receipt. My phone OS is Android version 13. GO apps version 3.2.09.
The app was very very veryyyyyy slowwwwww!!!!!! Couldn't make any transactions with this app. I am beyond disappointed. Edit: after the recent update, there's no more slow loading so i think they deseve more star
i want to carry out fpx transaction. so i need to use go app to approve the transaction. and goes on loading till the last 120s of the transaction. and when i got at the login page press go secure to approve the transaction. it repeatly tell me the transaction has expired, when i still have 120s. i did a few more time with the same result till transaction have really expired. ok i give another go, i reinstall the app, reregistered it for 3 more time to do the fpx and it still waste my time
From bad to worse. It was already laggy and slow before. Since the update, takes close to forever to load(my internet is running at 500mbps) . And the interface is very buggy. I can't do any transactions just an endless loop of returning to the home screen. I end up using chrome or my PC for any online transactions. Please this app really needs a major update & revamp. At a time when most things are online you might loose more customers bcoz other app(bank) are better
If there is an option to give 0 star, damn sure I'd give it without hesitation. Every time updates coming this app has become much much worse than before. Please fix your app and your server so we can log in without issue. Fix the damn issue asap or else we will port to another bank.
Half an hour loading to open the apps. Very very very bad apps for such a big finance company. Please let us used the browser instead of this app.. I repeat.. Very.. Very....very very.. Bad and junk apps.
I hate this app ever.... From September until the end of October, this app can't perform well even i have updated it... I can't do anything to my money in the bank. Already made some reports via email and call centre for this issue. Seem like no action from them.
Not intuitive to use. I cancelled my transfer settings and press OK on the dialog option, nothing happened, not even to the homepage. I tap on back button and the app not responding at all. Can't even find ASNB account summary or related (not transaction) but the bank have that service, really not good. Edit: No error, I wrote "Nothing happened" means I got any feedback from that? No, you didn't code any error message. That's even worst.
Unable to login,Already clear and uninstall the app.Still get the same error. There is no more,Go secure for approve transaction purpose.It is very dangerous since no safety in online transaction. YES,this is the latest version of app.
Worst app ever exist! Very slow and u need to activate go secure even for small amount transfer. Waste of time!! Once lag, it's going to lag forever.. in the end, need to uninstall and install it again. No improvement despite people giving reviews. Don't bother to create an app if it's only cause trouble every time u need to use it!!
My rating for this app has plummeted significantly lately among financial apps that I've used. Worst experience and seems buggy, it hangs frequently and randomly unresponsive, not able to connect, etc. Not easy for online payment. Getting tired of all sorts of issue for a financial apps from a Bank. Really needs to buck up and hope security is no compromised though!
Greetings to whom it might concern. You are a bank institution. There supposedly should not be any crashes, trouble opening, and unable to connect to the server every time. Please do something about this. I am so tired of having to close and open the app every time I wanted to do transactions and approvals. Worst, re-installing for dozens of times. Thus, I had trouble making simple payments. I hope to actually use your banking app smoothly. I look foward to see some improvements.
I have no words for how much I hate this app. Recently updated, now my transfer limit can't be changed on the app. It's a different limit from the mobile site, and it's a ridiculously low limit that I can't do anything with. Uninstalling and reinstalling for the umpteenth time and hope (yet again) that this will fix the problem.
Im so proud of bank islam. Most of the time this app cannot work, always loading screen and server error. However, rather than solving this issue you guys have a great idea by making transactions approval using the go app. So if we successfully log into the portal using web browser, we still need to open the app which is 99% does not work. What a fantastic idea! Btw, stop using AI to reply all reviews. Clearing cache wil not solve anything for this garbage system
Please upgrade your apps. Tells me to update, after updating the app, it says cannot connect to the server. Need to uninstall and re-install. Tired of doing the same thing all over again...if i can give u zero star, i would. Worst banking app ever. I don't know how many times already i uninstall and reinstall your app. Don't tell me about phone spec, never encountered this problem on any other banking app. 😤
Worst ever online banking app I've ever experienced. After having to install, uninstall and reinstall, it still failed to function. Doesn't even deserve 1-star. Please buck up!! and emulate other banks' secure app that have been proven to perform, no need to reinvent the wheel, just get it sorted out before imposing on customers to use such app for our online banking transactions.
App not responsive to touch input on landing/login page. Uninstalled and reinstalled still unresponsive, cannot tap 'get started'. Hope can fix soon.
Actually not bad if you compare with other bank software. User friendly UI, Easy to use, just abit slow sometimes. Other all good for me.
After update, cannot connect to the server. Need to uninstall and install it again. Loading time too long when need to do secure pay, untill timeout. Not much improvement compare to other internet banking apps after a year from my last reviewed.
I can see this app is improving. My only complaint is that it would be nice if this app would let guest user login using the app that already has a registered user ID. Sometimes, I'm helping my mom doing online transactions when I was at hostel, so it was troublesome to deregistered my Go bank account just to use Go secure using my mom Go bank account.
the app just updated and now i can't even make it to the login screen because of "server error". it's a pain and i need to use the app for online and cashless transactions, do fix this problem ASAP
too many bugs,slow apps eventhough signal at the area in good condition, need to improve on the apps efficiency,unable to screenshot as a evidence while performing any transaction.
Slow loading apps. Very, very, very, slow loading apps. Not that user friendly. Always had trouble using this apps.
Asked me to update employment status when I tried to login through web browser but need to approve via app. Downloaded the app, but need to enable unnecessary permissions. When enabled, server connection error. Head father you, your mother green.
Loading too long. Sometimes not working. Been using for so long but the problem still the same. Never improve. Difficult when trying to pay with qr code cause need to wait for too long.
I tried to transfer money from using website, it refuses and ask me to use this app. But when I install the app and try to transfer, I keep getting error "You are not allowed to perform this monetary transaction for 12 hours".
At account details page, my money are still there but it keep decreasing at home pages. It's frustrating. I can't make transaction. It keeps saying i don't have balance left
Pure connection. Already update handphone to android 10, but still fail to connect, although after using variety of internet line.
Notice that there is improvement on the application, especially it is much faster than before, which makes QR payment is possible. Keep up the good work.
The newer version app has improved a lot. No more lagging. Easy to log in. Online transfer has been easy. A+ for team effort
Unable to login after newly installed in new phone. Keeps saying connection to server is lost. Please fix. Thank you.
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE fix your app sometimes it will suddenly became error and i need to reinstall it REINSTALL ITT !!! IT'S SO FRUSTRATING !!! BECAUSE I USED THIS APP FOR MY DAILY WHEN I REINSTALL IT AGAIN I NEED TO WAIT 24 HOURS TO DO THE TRANSACTION (24 HOURS 24 HOURS) YOU THINK I HAVE TIME TO WAITTTT. I already read someone chat and i read your reply . You said you already fixed it. But you lying the problem are still not fixed .
Edit Again: Alhamdulillah the app nowadays is usable enough. They get rid of the useless feature that caused the app unusable in the previous version
Now it's unusable. Keep giving me error code 500 (APZ_TSN_500). I did everything I could, reinstall, clear cache and data. Only work for a brief moment after I reinstall / clear data and it doesn't work after I close and try to open the app. For some reason, it works perfectly on my friends phone.
Every single time when I want to use go app , it crashed . Why can't you just like before ? Sending TAC through SMS , it's a lot more easier and after using GO app everything when really bad .
Hi again its me your customer. Recently I try to make a few purchases from tiktok shop but after the first purchase, the system started to go crazy and it can't even able to process my purchase anymore.

A few times I had to reinstall the app just to fix the server error. It annoys me because clearing cache doesn't help at all to reset the connection to server. Why is that a problem? Basically the app becomes completely useless when the error starts popping up, reinstalling is the only option. We use this almost daily now.
Previous version apps are more batter than current apps. After I updated to a new apps the apps seems having a bad issues. 1. It is hard to open, and it takes more time to open. Loading too long. 2. Even though1 managed to log in, when I choose, as an example, to transfer a money, the apps will be loaded again, and it takes a long time to load. 3. Not so friendly like before, because when I would like to check other things inside the apps, the same issue happens. Please make changes

NOT USER FRIENDLY AT ALL!!! Last review, 1 star on December 2022, until today Nov 2024, this apps does not improve much. They include fingerprint to make the access easier, but not easy at all. I can easily access to see ny account with 1 time using fingerprint eith other banking apps, but not with this app. To open each section, it loading for so long. To get approval for transaction also take some time. What's the point moving to 5G era, but your app still slow.
for the past week I couldn't get pass the starting screen of the app and thus i can never access the app anymore. i have checked if there's any update but there were none and my phone meets the app requirement system. the web browser works fine but it is frustrating bc i can't use the app anymore to do instant transfers. fix this issue please this is too absurd
Cannot launch the app. Tried everything and yet the login page never appear, stucked at the front page forever. Read the latest reviews, and the developer keep on telling to update to latest version (3.2.09), which is what everyone already have update to, or use phone with android 9 and above. No solution or whatsover. Very disappointed with how little they care about clients' experience.
The app is so slow, and it will not open at all. I have to uninstall the app and reinstall it every time i want to use the app. After reinstalling, I can only use it once. The second time I try to use it, the same thing happens, and I will have to uninstall again. After reinstalling the app, I can't make any transfers to other banks for the next 12 hours. I feel like closing my account just because of this. This app is not convenient at all. In fact, it is troublesome to the users.
Too many errors occuring from time to time Either not being able to log in, not able to use the QR, and even worse, not even able to open the apps even after waiting for quite some time. Had to uninstall then reinstall the app. It is annoying as you need to enter your data all over again
PLEASE DO SOMETHING TO THE APPS!! after installed the updated version, it is always loading and stuck at the start up n i cant open the apps. Update on 28 oct 2023, i believe there is no improvement that bank islam done to their apps, which is super non friendly user, lagging, need to open and log in several times, i almost forget my password because rarely use it due to the issues.

Useless app !  Most of the time take time to load unable to connect to server. It's really frustrating. I had to reinstall the app when I need to do the transaction. Annoying !!!
i will close my account because if this incompetent app. now that you force to use app to validate any transfer but it does not even connect. i have clear cache, update, uninstall and reinstall before you even try to ask for me to update this app. even tried with wifi and my mobile 5G speed. this is just pure garbage of an app.
25/8/23: Guess I'm not changing my opinion anytime soon. Very, very rarely it was fast. Rest of the time? So slow that I forgot I have to pay for something. Now? I can't even go to the main page, keeps telling me to reinitiate transaction. WT--?? Like I have no life to live, is it, to wait for the app to actually work?
the most stupidest banking app.. it will take forever to load. on top of that if you want to perform duitnow transfer through the browser, you still need to open your go app. it's so annoying and it really makes me angry. i have very stable internet connection. Hey bimb please learn from cimb how to operate an app.
Unable to connect the server? Already update the latest version (as of 7 October 2023). Already uninstall and install again to see if it's working, but still doesn't working. If we need to call the center, every user of this app will end up calling Bank Islam. The problem is this app itself.
Very disappointing experience using bank islam go, it takes forever just to get to the log in screen, not to mention the problem while scanning qr codes and many more.. what's the point of yall taking RM 13 from our bank accounts if you didn't do anything to fix the goddamn app..no one will be furious if there is a slight inconvenience for a short period of time, but this app has been giving people nothing but trouble for quite some time..please step up your IT teams
Why i kept getting error "400 bad request", although i already key in my correct password and id also the tac number. After that error, the app send me msg that i already registered yet unable to to log in. Please resolve this, i already uninstall and reinstall for several time.. Dear BIMB, Again this app really needs improvement. As from all customers that seems to have the same issues, we really need you to solves it fast for us to used it again.
Please please please do stg about the app start up, I can't open the app no matter how many times I tried, and since some transcation require verification from this app it's really frustrating! Why in the world does everything need verification from the app anyway, the duitnow I get, the jompay I get, but why funds transfer too????
Sometimes it's working.... sometimes NOT. It continues to buffer. So unfriendly users. In fact my phone is new, install & uninstall 3 times by now & updated the apps to the latest version. But still the SAME prob reoccurring. Fix you apps pls!
Too slow, the app keep loading and in the end, the session expired just like that. One more thing... it keeps telling us to UPDATE BUT NOTHING'S CHANGED!! STILL THE SAME PROBLEMS OCCUR WHILE USING THE APP!! Please make improvement on the app so that IT WILL BE EASIER FOR US, THE USER OF THE APP!!
Often to unistall and install. Also been waiting for the IAC to be send to my number take years. Requested for so many times still did not received any In case of emergency to do any transaction, this is very much troublesome. Transaction via website also need approval from GO Bimb. How to if I can't even open the apps ?
I will be honest. This app is the worst. The loading takes too long for me to open the app. If its only a minute or two is okay but it takes 5 mintues or even more just to load? I've heard the issue is not new which proves this app is just that bad.
I've already updated to the new version but still couldn't open the app.. I don't know why it cannot connect to the server. I've tried using both wifi and data but still can't open.
Very bad apps.. Always stuck and nothing happened after wait 10 minutes. Causing me very bad experience to transfer money using western Union and PFX with your apps. Very very very bad!!!!
the apps are so bad, clear cache, etc, still unable to open the apps. Online transactions through the website need approval through GO secure, but nothing can be approved since the apps only trying to load the entire time
Took super long to open the apps. Most of the time i gave up. Would rather transfer all my money to other banks, easier when i need to do duitnow payment at the store. Im super close to stop using this app.
I mean i understand that many people are using this app, but you have to accommodate good service to them. Make frequent maintenance, if u already did u have to make it even more frequent. Please people are just trying to get their transactions through and if u are wishing to keep them as customers, please improve.
Frequently got problem to share the transaction receipt. There are 2 ways to share receipt in GO apps .... thru (menu) history mobile transaction or thru individual account transaction history. Both got blank receipt. My phone OS is Android version 13. GO apps version 3.2.09.
The app was very very veryyyyyy slowwwwww!!!!!! Couldn't make any transactions with this app. I am beyond disappointed. Edit: after the recent update, there's no more slow loading so i think they deseve more star
i want to carry out fpx transaction. so i need to use go app to approve the transaction. and goes on loading till the last 120s of the transaction. and when i got at the login page press go secure to approve the transaction. it repeatly tell me the transaction has expired, when i still have 120s. i did a few more time with the same result till transaction have really expired. ok i give another go, i reinstall the app, reregistered it for 3 more time to do the fpx and it still waste my time
From bad to worse. It was already laggy and slow before. Since the update, takes close to forever to load(my internet is running at 500mbps) . And the interface is very buggy. I can't do any transactions just an endless loop of returning to the home screen. I end up using chrome or my PC for any online transactions. Please this app really needs a major update & revamp. At a time when most things are online you might loose more customers bcoz other app(bank) are better
If there is an option to give 0 star, damn sure I'd give it without hesitation. Every time updates coming this app has become much much worse than before. Please fix your app and your server so we can log in without issue. Fix the damn issue asap or else we will port to another bank.
Half an hour loading to open the apps. Very very very bad apps for such a big finance company. Please let us used the browser instead of this app.. I repeat.. Very.. Very....very very.. Bad and junk apps.
I hate this app ever.... From September until the end of October, this app can't perform well even i have updated it... I can't do anything to my money in the bank. Already made some reports via email and call centre for this issue. Seem like no action from them.
Not intuitive to use. I cancelled my transfer settings and press OK on the dialog option, nothing happened, not even to the homepage. I tap on back button and the app not responding at all. Can't even find ASNB account summary or related (not transaction) but the bank have that service, really not good. Edit: No error, I wrote "Nothing happened" means I got any feedback from that? No, you didn't code any error message. That's even worst.
Unable to login,Already clear and uninstall the app.Still get the same error. There is no more,Go secure for approve transaction purpose.It is very dangerous since no safety in online transaction. YES,this is the latest version of app.
Worst app ever exist! Very slow and u need to activate go secure even for small amount transfer. Waste of time!! Once lag, it's going to lag forever.. in the end, need to uninstall and install it again. No improvement despite people giving reviews. Don't bother to create an app if it's only cause trouble every time u need to use it!!
My rating for this app has plummeted significantly lately among financial apps that I've used. Worst experience and seems buggy, it hangs frequently and randomly unresponsive, not able to connect, etc. Not easy for online payment. Getting tired of all sorts of issue for a financial apps from a Bank. Really needs to buck up and hope security is no compromised though!
Greetings to whom it might concern. You are a bank institution. There supposedly should not be any crashes, trouble opening, and unable to connect to the server every time. Please do something about this. I am so tired of having to close and open the app every time I wanted to do transactions and approvals. Worst, re-installing for dozens of times. Thus, I had trouble making simple payments. I hope to actually use your banking app smoothly. I look foward to see some improvements.
I have no words for how much I hate this app. Recently updated, now my transfer limit can't be changed on the app. It's a different limit from the mobile site, and it's a ridiculously low limit that I can't do anything with. Uninstalling and reinstalling for the umpteenth time and hope (yet again) that this will fix the problem.
Im so proud of bank islam. Most of the time this app cannot work, always loading screen and server error. However, rather than solving this issue you guys have a great idea by making transactions approval using the go app. So if we successfully log into the portal using web browser, we still need to open the app which is 99% does not work. What a fantastic idea! Btw, stop using AI to reply all reviews. Clearing cache wil not solve anything for this garbage system
Please upgrade your apps. Tells me to update, after updating the app, it says cannot connect to the server. Need to uninstall and re-install. Tired of doing the same thing all over again...if i can give u zero star, i would. Worst banking app ever. I don't know how many times already i uninstall and reinstall your app. Don't tell me about phone spec, never encountered this problem on any other banking app. 😤
Worst ever online banking app I've ever experienced. After having to install, uninstall and reinstall, it still failed to function. Doesn't even deserve 1-star. Please buck up!! and emulate other banks' secure app that have been proven to perform, no need to reinvent the wheel, just get it sorted out before imposing on customers to use such app for our online banking transactions.
App not responsive to touch input on landing/login page. Uninstalled and reinstalled still unresponsive, cannot tap 'get started'. Hope can fix soon.
Actually not bad if you compare with other bank software. User friendly UI, Easy to use, just abit slow sometimes. Other all good for me.
After update, cannot connect to the server. Need to uninstall and install it again. Loading time too long when need to do secure pay, untill timeout. Not much improvement compare to other internet banking apps after a year from my last reviewed.
I can see this app is improving. My only complaint is that it would be nice if this app would let guest user login using the app that already has a registered user ID. Sometimes, I'm helping my mom doing online transactions when I was at hostel, so it was troublesome to deregistered my Go bank account just to use Go secure using my mom Go bank account.
the app just updated and now i can't even make it to the login screen because of "server error". it's a pain and i need to use the app for online and cashless transactions, do fix this problem ASAP
too many bugs,slow apps eventhough signal at the area in good condition, need to improve on the apps efficiency,unable to screenshot as a evidence while performing any transaction.
Slow loading apps. Very, very, very, slow loading apps. Not that user friendly. Always had trouble using this apps.
Asked me to update employment status when I tried to login through web browser but need to approve via app. Downloaded the app, but need to enable unnecessary permissions. When enabled, server connection error. Head father you, your mother green.
Loading too long. Sometimes not working. Been using for so long but the problem still the same. Never improve. Difficult when trying to pay with qr code cause need to wait for too long.
I tried to transfer money from using website, it refuses and ask me to use this app. But when I install the app and try to transfer, I keep getting error "You are not allowed to perform this monetary transaction for 12 hours".
At account details page, my money are still there but it keep decreasing at home pages. It's frustrating. I can't make transaction. It keeps saying i don't have balance left
Pure connection. Already update handphone to android 10, but still fail to connect, although after using variety of internet line.
Notice that there is improvement on the application, especially it is much faster than before, which makes QR payment is possible. Keep up the good work.
The newer version app has improved a lot. No more lagging. Easy to log in. Online transfer has been easy. A+ for team effort
Unable to login after newly installed in new phone. Keeps saying connection to server is lost. Please fix. Thank you.
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE fix your app sometimes it will suddenly became error and i need to reinstall it REINSTALL ITT !!! IT'S SO FRUSTRATING !!! BECAUSE I USED THIS APP FOR MY DAILY WHEN I REINSTALL IT AGAIN I NEED TO WAIT 24 HOURS TO DO THE TRANSACTION (24 HOURS 24 HOURS) YOU THINK I HAVE TIME TO WAITTTT. I already read someone chat and i read your reply . You said you already fixed it. But you lying the problem are still not fixed .
Edit Again: Alhamdulillah the app nowadays is usable enough. They get rid of the useless feature that caused the app unusable in the previous version
Now it's unusable. Keep giving me error code 500 (APZ_TSN_500). I did everything I could, reinstall, clear cache and data. Only work for a brief moment after I reinstall / clear data and it doesn't work after I close and try to open the app. For some reason, it works perfectly on my friends phone.
Every single time when I want to use go app , it crashed . Why can't you just like before ? Sending TAC through SMS , it's a lot more easier and after using GO app everything when really bad .
Hi again its me your customer. Recently I try to make a few purchases from tiktok shop but after the first purchase, the system started to go crazy and it can't even able to process my purchase anymore. It unfortunately cancelled out my promo payment hence why I'm rating it 1 star. Please kindly fix this issue.
lousy lousy lousy still..updated oct 2023 . Frustrating lately since up-dating this app recently, always unable to connect. Why give us this trouble now? after many years hassle free without un-install and install. Fix this!!! Nothing being done. Stop replying me the same stupid answer like the others.
I want to pay my uni fee, but I can't pay it through online because it's keep loading. I prefer, the old version where we just need to put code from SMS from need permission from aps. Because this app will stuck. I want to pay my uni fee!!!!
Sorry to say. Very bad and bad system ever. After update the latest one I cannot access my online banking. Always lagging all the time even though using wifi. Waste time waiting & drag my time also.
The apps took tooooo long to open since the update. It hinder all my transfer since it need go secure and the page won't open even the homepage. Please fix it asap
Worst bank app service ever. Low maintenance and really annoying to handle such simple tasks. Buffer all the time and not even a message to inform in the app have problems to be fixed.
Apps Loading time during peak and non peak hours are terrible. If other banks's apps can be efficient in terms of loading time and etc, bank islam should make initiatives to develop an app that is on par with other apps. Show some class 😮‍💨
Your notification was so bad. No information regarding the need to upgrade, uninstall and reinstall. Your sense of urgency is so bad that you not allow customer to perform transaction right after installing the app. Instead, you asked for a cooling off 12 hours? Are you running a beta version on BIMB customer? You made 12 hours of misery.
I cleared app cache and data. Tried again. Its working. Thank you. Just that the tag that comes in into the phone only works at the second attempt.. not the first.
Bad experience, and looks like no improvement even though customers rate low. I think you should test your apps thoroughly. It is still the same even you have upgraded the version. Please be serious on improving your customer experience.
I am using this app since last 3 years. This is so frustrating. The App doesn’t work when you need it the most. I think the developers of this App are too lazy to fix the issues. Going to switch to another bank this week. Bye bye Bank Islam.
cannot use during payday week, most of the time hang during transaction,go apps becomes not go apps..the 1st version way much better than current. What a dissapointed experienced!
Its getting worse..i hope you guys can fix this problem..its already a couple of days but i still can't login to the apps..i always update the apps..but it's doesn't seem to be a changes at all..
Truly disappointed! After so many attempt trying to login with password still invalid! We only able to login with same password and username thru website using chrome browser. Please do something with your crash app!
Very slow. Every day I will uninstall and reinstall back. Than need to wait another 12hrs for transfer. Poor app. Why keep continue such services. Very sorry. Very frustrating.
The worst experience ever in all history of Online Banking app. This app is super slow considering how every user's bank account need verification from this app and yet it took forever to load. Such disappointment
The previous version is much better than now. I can't even log in to do my transaction and there's always error that I getting annoyed now 😑. Please fix it quickly
The latest mandatory update is full of bugs. I can't open it well especially when I need to transfer my money. The previous version is way better.
Please make an improvement to your apps, I'm very frustrated and annoyed each time to make any payments because this apps keep take a long time on loading page before going to login page. Please Bank Islam, do better.
The apps is not workable, lagging and not able to log in all the times, resulting in broken dateline and promises( so not islamic at all). Pls pls do something or do we need to report to PMX as well. It has improved and i m satisfied now
After updating still no improvement. After one transaction succsess, next transaction always failed. Always need to log out and delete cache, then can do the transaction. Becoming worst every year.
Can't login, at first didn't approved access, then as it is compulsory, allowed the access, but get error "Unable to connect to the server" Off, clear cached, still can't get through
i can't log in Go By Bank Islam (it said Invalid Credential) eventhough i updated to the latest version and my device is not old version, i told to the email (contact centre) and no response at all, please fix it ASAP, i need to use the app
Just recently update the app, and now i can't even open it😑 it says can't connect to server. Edited: thank you Bank Islam. I follow ur instruction. I delete my app and install it again. It worked
One of the worst app that I ever downloaded. I used to pay via fpx online but after the new update, I need to get permission from this Go app and sometimes it doesn't even work and after the latest update I can't pay to purchase something online💆‍♂️
Very inconvenient. Unstable and non worked app. Cant even open the app and just keep loading. I want to give negative star for this useless thing. Rework this disappointing thing.
Cannot access Tabung Haji even with latest update. App condition somehow as if it's an app made by a guy who just build their first app. It's bank app so with current performance, it's a disappointment.
Told me to use the app instead of website. But the app cannot even open. So how can I transfer and stuff. So disappointed especially during emergency...
Why does it keep buffering? I'm unable to make any purchases. Help please Latest: I've already updated it. Still the same, is it need a very good internet connection?
Please I'm begging you please update and fix the system..its been down with server error for weeks and this is not the 1st time. Sometimes it takes hours just to load -whattt??
Hi there, what has happened to this app, I can't log in even i tried many time. Previous version has better version than this new version. Please improve this kind of problem.
Unusable. App will stay on the loading page endlessly. Its been going on for months! Update 02/10/2023: Latest updates makes it even worse. Did you guys hire a bunch monkeys to manage this app? Didn't gave them enough bananas?
apsal app ni slow sgt.. Bi kena lebih improve customer service n satisfaction ni.. 4 app yg lain semua jauh lbh lancar. Once account freezed, and it keep repeating wrong password.. and u have to wait for 12 hours to make a transaction, this is nonsense service.. I'll better move to other banks..
Worst mobile apps ever. It didn't work properly and not even able to open it most of the time especially for Android user.
The app some time not available as before . The loading process take a several times. Some time i got fed up with this app. Please make it smooth like your take it money from us.
for many times, i try and try but still cannot login and of course it happens during the most urgent period. worthless apps!
Previous update was better than current. Dont know if there any maintenance, app and web both take more time loading and lag when enter it. Please make good your system
Just wanted to let the devs know that the app was not able to connect to the BIMB server after the latest update. I tried updating, clearing cache, clearing storage and nothing works. It only worked again after reinstalling the app. I loved the app but it will be even more amazing if the GUI is more fluid, though that's just me being picky. Hopefully the next update is smooth as it's been a recurring issue. Kudos to the devs.
Please fix the app. Sometimes it takes time to load, unable to connect to server but when accessing internet banking through the browser works just fine.

I will be honest. This app is the worst. The loading takes too long for me to open the app. If its only a minute or two is okay but it takes 5 mintues or even more just to load? I've heard the issue is not new which proves this app is just that bad.
I've already updated to the new version but still couldn't open the app.. I don't know why it cannot connect to the server. I've tried using both wifi and data but still can't open.
Very bad apps.. Always stuck and nothing happened after wait 10 minutes. Causing me very bad experience to transfer money using western Union and PFX with your apps. Very very very bad!!!!
the apps are so bad, clear cache, etc, still unable to open the apps. Online transactions through the website need approval through GO secure, but nothing can be approved since the apps only trying to load the entire time
Took super long to open the apps. Most of the time i gave up. Would rather transfer all my money to other banks, easier when i need to do duitnow payment at the store. Im super close to stop using this app.
I mean i understand that many people are using this app, but you have to accommodate good service to them. Make frequent maintenance, if u already did u have to make it even more frequent. Please people are just trying to get their transactions through and if u are wishing to keep them as customers, please improve.
Frequently got problem to share the transaction receipt. There are 2 ways to share receipt in GO apps .... thru (menu) history mobile transaction or thru individual account transaction history. Both got blank receipt. My phone OS is Android version 13. GO apps version 3.2.09.
The app was very very veryyyyyy slowwwwww!!!!!! Couldn't make any transactions with this app. I am beyond disappointed. Edit: after the recent update, there's no more slow loading so i think they deseve more star
i want to carry out fpx transaction. so i need to use go app to approve the transaction. and goes on loading till the last 120s of the transaction. and when i got at the login page press go secure to approve the transaction. it repeatly tell me the transaction has expired, when i still have 120s. i did a few more time with the same result till transaction have really expired. ok i give another go, i reinstall the app, reregistered it for 3 more time to do the fpx and it still waste my time
From bad to worse. It was already laggy and slow before. Since the update, takes close to forever to load(my internet is running at 500mbps) . And the interface is very buggy. I can't do any transactions just an endless loop of returning to the home screen. I end up using chrome or my PC for any online transactions. Please this app really needs a major update & revamp. At a time when most things are online you might loose more customers bcoz other app(bank) are better
If there is an option to give 0 star, damn sure I'd give it without hesitation. Every time updates coming this app has become much much worse than before. Please fix your app and your server so we can log in without issue. Fix the damn issue asap or else we will port to another bank.
Half an hour loading to open the apps. Very very very bad apps for such a big finance company. Please let us used the browser instead of this app.. I repeat.. Very.. Very....very very.. Bad and junk apps.
I hate this app ever.... From September until the end of October, this app can't perform well even i have updated it... I can't do anything to my money in the bank. Already made some reports via email and call centre for this issue. Seem like no action from them.
Not intuitive to use. I cancelled my transfer settings and press OK on the dialog option, nothing happened, not even to the homepage. I tap on back button and the app not responding at all. Can't even find ASNB account summary or related (not transaction) but the bank have that service, really not good. Edit: No error, I wrote "Nothing happened" means I got any feedback from that? No, you didn't code any error message. That's even worst.
Unable to login,Already clear and uninstall the app.Still get the same error. There is no more,Go secure for approve transaction purpose.It is very dangerous since no safety in online transaction. YES,this is the latest version of app.
Worst app ever exist! Very slow and u need to activate go secure even for small amount transfer. Waste of time!! Once lag, it's going to lag forever.. in the end, need to uninstall and install it again. No improvement despite people giving reviews. Don't bother to create an app if it's only cause trouble every time u need to use it!!
My rating for this app has plummeted significantly lately among financial apps that I've used. Worst experience and seems buggy, it hangs frequently and randomly unresponsive, not able to connect, etc. Not easy for online payment. Getting tired of all sorts of issue for a financial apps from a Bank. Really needs to buck up and hope security is no compromised though!
Greetings to whom it might concern. You are a bank institution. There supposedly should not be any crashes, trouble opening, and unable to connect to the server every time. Please do something about this. I am so tired of having to close and open the app every time I wanted to do transactions and approvals. Worst, re-installing for dozens of times. Thus, I had trouble making simple payments. I hope to actually use your banking app smoothly. I look foward to see some improvements.
I have no words for how much I hate this app. Recently updated, now my transfer limit can't be changed on the app. It's a different limit from the mobile site, and it's a ridiculously low limit that I can't do anything with. Uninstalling and reinstalling for the umpteenth time and hope (yet again) that this will fix the problem.
Im so proud of bank islam. Most of the time this app cannot work, always loading screen and server error. However, rather than solving this issue you guys have a great idea by making transactions approval using the go app. So if we successfully log into the portal using web browser, we still need to open the app which is 99% does not work. What a fantastic idea! Btw, stop using AI to reply all reviews. Clearing cache wil not solve anything for this garbage system
Please upgrade your apps. Tells me to update, after updating the app, it says cannot connect to the server. Need to uninstall and re-install. Tired of doing the same thing all over again...if i can give u zero star, i would. Worst banking app ever. I don't know how many times already i uninstall and reinstall your app. Don't tell me about phone spec, never encountered this problem on any other banking app. 😤
Worst ever online banking app I've ever experienced. After having to install, uninstall and reinstall, it still failed to function. Doesn't even deserve 1-star. Please buck up!! and emulate other banks' secure app that have been proven to perform, no need to reinvent the wheel, just get it sorted out before imposing on customers to use such app for our online banking transactions.
App not responsive to touch input on landing/login page. Uninstalled and reinstalled still unresponsive, cannot tap 'get started'. Hope can fix soon.
Actually not bad if you compare with other bank software. User friendly UI, Easy to use, just abit slow sometimes. Other all good for me.
After update, cannot connect to the server. Need to uninstall and install it again. Loading time too long when need to do secure pay, untill timeout. Not much improvement compare to other internet banking apps after a year from my last reviewed.
I can see this app is improving. My only complaint is that it would be nice if this app would let guest user login using the app that already has a registered user ID. Sometimes, I'm helping my mom doing online transactions when I was at hostel, so it was troublesome to deregistered my Go bank account just to use Go secure using my mom Go bank account.
the app just updated and now i can't even make it to the login screen because of "server error". it's a pain and i need to use the app for online and cashless transactions, do fix this problem ASAP
too many bugs,slow apps eventhough signal at the area in good condition, need to improve on the apps efficiency,unable to screenshot as a evidence while performing any transaction.
Slow loading apps. Very, very, very, slow loading apps. Not that user friendly. Always had trouble using this apps.
Asked me to update employment status when I tried to login through web browser but need to approve via app. Downloaded the app, but need to enable unnecessary permissions. When enabled, server connection error. Head father you, your mother green.
Loading too long. Sometimes not working. Been using for so long but the problem still the same. Never improve. Difficult when trying to pay with qr code cause need to wait for too long.
I tried to transfer money from using website, it refuses and ask me to use this app. But when I install the app and try to transfer, I keep getting error "You are not allowed to perform this monetary transaction for 12 hours".
At account details page, my money are still there but it keep decreasing at home pages. It's frustrating. I can't make transaction. It keeps saying i don't have balance left
Pure connection. Already update handphone to android 10, but still fail to connect, although after using variety of internet line.
Notice that there is improvement on the application, especially it is much faster than before, which makes QR payment is possible. Keep up the good work.
The newer version app has improved a lot. No more lagging. Easy to log in. Online transfer has been easy. A+ for team effort
Unable to login after newly installed in new phone. Keeps saying connection to server is lost. Please fix. Thank you.
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE fix your app sometimes it will suddenly became error and i need to reinstall it REINSTALL ITT !!! IT'S SO FRUSTRATING !!! BECAUSE I USED THIS APP FOR MY DAILY WHEN I REINSTALL IT AGAIN I NEED TO WAIT 24 HOURS TO DO THE TRANSACTION (24 HOURS 24 HOURS) YOU THINK I HAVE TIME TO WAITTTT. I already read someone chat and i read your reply . You said you already fixed it. But you lying the problem are still not fixed .
Edit Again: Alhamdulillah the app nowadays is usable enough. They get rid of the useless feature that caused the app unusable in the previous version
Now it's unusable. Keep giving me error code 500 (APZ_TSN_500). I did everything I could, reinstall, clear cache and data. Only work for a brief moment after I reinstall / clear data and it doesn't work after I close and try to open the app. For some reason, it works perfectly on my friends phone.
Every single time when I want to use go app , it crashed . Why can't you just like before ? Sending TAC through SMS , it's a lot more easier and after using GO app everything when really bad .
Hi again its me your customer. Recently I try to make a few purchases from tiktok shop but after the first purchase, the system started to go crazy and it can't even able to process my purchase anymore. It unfortunately cancelled out my promo payment hence why I'm rating it 1 star. Please kindly fix this issue.
lousy lousy lousy still..updated oct 2023 . Frustrating lately since up-dating this app recently, always unable to connect. Why give us this trouble now? after many years hassle free without un-install and install. Fix this!!! Nothing being done. Stop replying me the same stupid answer like the others.
I want to pay my uni fee, but I can't pay it through online because it's keep loading. I prefer, the old version where we just need to put code from SMS from need permission from aps. Because this app will stuck. I want to pay my uni fee!!!!
Sorry to say. Very bad and bad system ever. After update the latest one I cannot access my online banking. Always lagging all the time even though using wifi. Waste time waiting & drag my time also.
The apps took tooooo long to open since the update. It hinder all my transfer since it need go secure and the page won't open even the homepage. Please fix it asap
Worst bank app service ever. Low maintenance and really annoying to handle such simple tasks. Buffer all the time and not even a message to inform in the app have problems to be fixed.
Apps Loading time during peak and non peak hours are terrible. If other banks's apps can be efficient in terms of loading time and etc, bank islam should make initiatives to develop an app that is on par with other apps. Show some class 😮‍💨
Your notification was so bad. No information regarding the need to upgrade, uninstall and reinstall. Your sense of urgency is so bad that you not allow customer to perform transaction right after installing the app. Instead, you asked for a cooling off 12 hours? Are you running a beta version on BIMB customer? You made 12 hours of misery.
I cleared app cache and data. Tried again. Its working. Thank you. Just that the tag that comes in into the phone only works at the second attempt.. not the first.
Bad experience, and looks like no improvement even though customers rate low. I think you should test your apps thoroughly. It is still the same even you have upgraded the version. Please be serious on improving your customer experience.
I am using this app since last 3 years. This is so frustrating. The App doesn’t work when you need it the most. I think the developers of this App are too lazy to fix the issues. Going to switch to another bank this week. Bye bye Bank Islam.
cannot use during payday week, most of the time hang during transaction,go apps becomes not go apps..the 1st version way much better than current. What a dissapointed experienced!
Its getting worse..i hope you guys can fix this problem..its already a couple of days but i still can't login to the apps..i always update the apps..but it's doesn't seem to be a changes at all..
Truly disappointed! After so many attempt trying to login with password still invalid! We only able to login with same password and username thru website using chrome browser. Please do something with your crash app!
Very slow. Every day I will uninstall and reinstall back. Than need to wait another 12hrs for transfer. Poor app. Why keep continue such services. Very sorry. Very frustrating.
The worst experience ever in all history of Online Banking app. This app is super slow considering how every user's bank account need verification from this app and yet it took forever to load. Such disappointment
The previous version is much better than now. I can't even log in to do my transaction and there's always error that I getting annoyed now 😑. Please fix it quickly
The latest mandatory update is full of bugs. I can't open it well especially when I need to transfer my money. The previous version is way better.
Please make an improvement to your apps, I'm very frustrated and annoyed each time to make any payments because this apps keep take a long time on loading page before going to login page. Please Bank Islam, do better.
The apps is not workable, lagging and not able to log in all the times, resulting in broken dateline and promises( so not islamic at all). Pls pls do something or do we need to report to PMX as well. It has improved and i m satisfied now
After updating still no improvement. After one transaction succsess, next transaction always failed. Always need to log out and delete cache, then can do the transaction. Becoming worst every year.
Can't login, at first didn't approved access, then as it is compulsory, allowed the access, but get error "Unable to connect to the server" Off, clear cached, still can't get through
i can't log in Go By Bank Islam (it said Invalid Credential) eventhough i updated to the latest version and my device is not old version, i told to the email (contact centre) and no response at all, please fix it ASAP, i need to use the app
Just recently update the app, and now i can't even open it😑 it says can't connect to server. Edited: thank you Bank Islam. I follow ur instruction. I delete my app and install it again. It worked
One of the worst app that I ever downloaded. I used to pay via fpx online but after the new update, I need to get permission from this Go app and sometimes it doesn't even work and after the latest update I can't pay to purchase something online💆‍♂️
Very inconvenient. Unstable and non worked app. Cant even open the app and just keep loading. I want to give negative star for this useless thing. Rework this disappointing thing.
Cannot access Tabung Haji even with latest update. App condition somehow as if it's an app made by a guy who just build their first app. It's bank app so with current performance, it's a disappointment.
Told me to use the app instead of website. But the app cannot even open. So how can I transfer and stuff. So disappointed especially during emergency...
Why does it keep buffering? I'm unable to make any purchases. Help please Latest: I've already updated it. Still the same, is it need a very good internet connection?
Please I'm begging you please update and fix the system..its been down with server error for weeks and this is not the 1st time. Sometimes it takes hours just to load -whattt??
Hi there, what has happened to this app, I can't log in even i tried many time. Previous version has better version than this new version. Please improve this kind of problem.
Unusable. App will stay on the loading page endlessly. Its been going on for months! Update 02/10/2023: Latest updates makes it even worse. Did you guys hire a bunch monkeys to manage this app? Didn't gave them enough bananas?
apsal app ni slow sgt.. Bi kena lebih improve customer service n satisfaction ni.. 4 app yg lain semua jauh lbh lancar. Once account freezed, and it keep repeating wrong password.. and u have to wait for 12 hours to make a transaction, this is nonsense service.. I'll better move to other banks..
Worst mobile apps ever. It didn't work properly and not even able to open it most of the time especially for Android user.
The app some time not available as before . The loading process take a several times. Some time i got fed up with this app. Please make it smooth like your take it money from us.
for many times, i try and try but still cannot login and of course it happens during the most urgent period. worthless apps!
Previous update was better than current. Dont know if there any maintenance, app and web both take more time loading and lag when enter it. Please make good your system
Just wanted to let the devs know that the app was not able to connect to the BIMB server after the latest update. I tried updating, clearing cache, clearing storage and nothing works. It only worked again after reinstalling the app. I loved the app but it will be even more amazing if the GUI is more fluid, though that's just me being picky. Hopefully the next update is smooth as it's been a recurring issue. Kudos to the devs.
Please fix the app. Sometimes it takes time to load, unable to connect to server but when accessing internet banking through the browser works just fine. A few times I had to reinstall the app just to fix the server error. It annoys me because clearing cache doesn't help at all to reset the connection to server. Why is that a problem? Basically the app becomes completely useless when the error starts popping up, reinstalling is the only option. We use this almost daily now.
Previous version apps are more batter than current apps. After I updated to a new apps the apps seems having a bad issues. 1. It is hard to open, and it takes more time to open. Loading too long. 2. Even though1 managed to log in, when I choose, as an example, to transfer a money, the apps will be loaded again, and it takes a long time to load. 3. Not so friendly like before, because when I would like to check other things inside the apps, the same issue happens. Please make changes

I cannot even pay using online banking due to problem service.
NOT USER FRIENDLY AT ALL!!! Last review, 1 star on December 2022, until today Nov 2024, this apps does not improve much. They include fingerprint to make the access easier, but not easy at all. I can easily access to see ny account with 1 time using fingerprint eith other banking apps, but not with this app. To open each section, it loading for so long. To get approval for transaction also take some time. What's the point moving to 5G era, but your app still slow.
for the past week I couldn't get pass the starting screen of the app and thus i can never access the app anymore. i have checked if there's any update but there were none and my phone meets the app requirement system. the web browser works fine but it is frustrating bc i can't use the app anymore to do instant transfers. fix this issue please this is too absurd
Cannot launch the app. Tried everything and yet the login page never appear, stucked at the front page forever. Read the latest reviews, and the developer keep on telling to update to latest version (3.2.09), which is what everyone already have update to, or use phone with android 9 and above. No solution or whatsover. Very disappointed with how little they care about clients' experience.
The app is so slow, and it will not open at all. I have to uninstall the app and reinstall it every time i want to use the app. After reinstalling, I can only use it once. The second time I try to use it, the same thing happens, and I will have to uninstall again. After reinstalling the app, I can't make any transfers to other banks for the next 12 hours. I feel like closing my account just because of this. This app is not convenient at all. In fact, it is troublesome to the users.
Too many errors occuring from time to time Either not being able to log in, not able to use the QR, and even worse, not even able to open the apps even after waiting for quite some time. Had to uninstall then reinstall the app. It is annoying as you need to enter your data all over again
PLEASE DO SOMETHING TO THE APPS!! after installed the updated version, it is always loading and stuck at the start up n i cant open the apps. Update on 28 oct 2023, i believe there is no improvement that bank islam done to their apps, which is super non friendly user, lagging, need to open and log in several times, i almost forget my password because rarely use it due to the issues.

Useless app !  Most of the time take time to load unable to connect to server. It's really frustrating. I had to reinstall the app when I need to do the transaction. Annoying !!!
i will close my account because if this incompetent app. now that you force to use app to validate any transfer but it does not even connect. i have clear cache, update, uninstall and reinstall before you even try to ask for me to update this app. even tried with wifi and my mobile 5G speed. this is just pure garbage of an app.
25/8/23: Guess I'm not changing my opinion anytime soon. Very, very rarely it was fast. Rest of the time? So slow that I forgot I have to pay for something. Now? I can't even go to the main page, keeps telling me to reinitiate transaction. WT--?? Like I have no life to live, is it, to wait for the app to actually work?
the most stupidest banking app.. it will take forever to load. on top of that if you want to perform duitnow transfer through the browser, you still need to open your go app. it's so annoying and it really makes me angry. i have very stable internet connection. Hey bimb please learn from cimb how to operate an app.
Unable to connect the server? Already update the latest version (as of 7 October 2023). Already uninstall and install again to see if it's working, but still doesn't working. If we need to call the center, every user of this app will end up calling Bank Islam. The problem is this app itself.
Very disappointing experience using bank islam go, it takes forever just to get to the log in screen, not to mention the problem while scanning qr codes and many more.. what's the point of yall taking RM 13 from our bank accounts if you didn't do anything to fix the goddamn app..no one will be furious if there is a slight inconvenience for a short period of time, but this app has been giving people nothing but trouble for quite some time..please step up your IT teams
Why i kept getting error "400 bad request", although i already key in my correct password and id also the tac number. After that error, the app send me msg that i already registered yet unable to to log in. Please resolve this, i already uninstall and reinstall for several time.. Dear BIMB, Again this app really needs improvement. As from all customers that seems to have the same issues, we really need you to solves it fast for us to used it again.
Please please please do stg about the app start up, I can't open the app no matter how many times I tried, and since some transcation require verification from this app it's really frustrating! Why in the world does everything need verification from the app anyway, the duitnow I get, the jompay I get, but why funds transfer too????
Sometimes it's working.... sometimes NOT. It continues to buffer. So unfriendly users. In fact my phone is new, install & uninstall 3 times by now & updated the apps to the latest version. But still the SAME prob reoccurring. Fix you apps pls!
Too slow, the app keep loading and in the end, the session expired just like that. One more thing... it keeps telling us to UPDATE BUT NOTHING'S CHANGED!! STILL THE SAME PROBLEMS OCCUR WHILE USING THE APP!! Please make improvement on the app so that IT WILL BE EASIER FOR US, THE USER OF THE APP!!
Often to unistall and install. Also been waiting for the IAC to be send to my number take years. Requested for so many times still did not received any In case of emergency to do any transaction, this is very much troublesome. Transaction via website also need approval from GO Bimb. How to if I can't even open the apps ?
I will be honest. This app is the worst. The loading takes too long for me to open the app. If its only a minute or two is okay but it takes 5 mintues or even more just to load? I've heard the issue is not new which proves this app is just that bad.
I've already updated to the new version but still couldn't open the app.. I don't know why it cannot connect to the server. I've tried using both wifi and data but still can't open.
Very bad apps.. Always stuck and nothing happened after wait 10 minutes. Causing me very bad experience to transfer money using western Union and PFX with your apps. Very very very bad!!!!
the apps are so bad, clear cache, etc, still unable to open the apps. Online transactions through the website need approval through GO secure, but nothing can be approved since the apps only trying to load the entire time

the app just updated and now i can't even make it to the login screen because of "server error". it's a pain and i need to use the app for online and cashless transactions, do fix this problem ASAP
too many bugs,slow apps eventhough signal at the area in good condition, need to improve on the apps efficiency,unable to screenshot as a evidence while performing any transaction.
Slow loading apps. Very, very, very, slow loading apps. Not that user friendly. Always had trouble using this apps.
Asked me to update employment status when I tried to login through web browser but need to approve via app. Downloaded the app, but need to enable unnecessary permissions. When enabled, server connection error. Head father you, your mother green.
Loading too long. Sometimes not working. Been using for so long but the problem still the same. Never improve. Difficult when trying to pay with qr code cause need to wait for too long.
I tried to transfer money from using website, it refuses and ask me to use this app. But when I install the app and try to transfer, I keep getting error "You are not allowed to perform this monetary transaction for 12 hours".
At account details page, my money are still there but it keep decreasing at home pages. It's frustrating. I can't make transaction. It keeps saying i don't have balance left
Pure connection. Already update handphone to android 10, but still fail to connect, although after using variety of internet line.
Notice that there is improvement on the application, especially it is much faster than before, which makes QR payment is possible. Keep up the good work.
The newer version app has improved a lot. No more lagging. Easy to log in. Online transfer has been easy. A+ for team effort
Unable to login after newly installed in new phone. Keeps saying connection to server is lost. Please fix. Thank you.
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE fix your app sometimes it will suddenly became error and i need to reinstall it REINSTALL ITT !!! IT'S SO FRUSTRATING !!! BECAUSE I USED THIS APP FOR MY DAILY WHEN I REINSTALL IT AGAIN I NEED TO WAIT 24 HOURS TO DO THE TRANSACTION (24 HOURS 24 HOURS) YOU THINK I HAVE TIME TO WAITTTT. I already read someone chat and i read your reply . You said you already fixed it. But you lying the problem are still not fixed .
Edit Again: Alhamdulillah the app nowadays is usable enough. They get rid of the useless feature that caused the app unusable in the previous version
Now it's unusable. Keep giving me error code 500 (APZ_TSN_500). I did everything I could, reinstall, clear cache and data. Only work for a brief moment after I reinstall / clear data and it doesn't work after I close and try to open the app. For some reason, it works perfectly on my friends phone.
Every single time when I want to use go app , it crashed . Why can't you just like before ? Sending TAC through SMS , it's a lot more easier and after using GO app everything when really bad .
Hi again its me your customer. Recently I try to make a few purchases from tiktok shop but after the first purchase, the system started to go crazy and it can't even able to process my purchase anymore. It unfortunately cancelled out my promo payment hence why I'm rating it 1 star. Please kindly fix this issue.
lousy lousy lousy still..updated oct 2023 . Frustrating lately since up-dating this app recently, always unable to connect. Why give us this trouble now? after many years hassle free without un-install and install. Fix this!!! Nothing being done. Stop replying me the same stupid answer like the others.
I want to pay my uni fee, but I can't pay it through online because it's keep loading. I prefer, the old version where we just need to put code from SMS from need permission from aps. Because this app will stuck. I want to pay my uni fee!!!!
Sorry to say. Very bad and bad system ever. After update the latest one I cannot access my online banking. Always lagging all the time even though using wifi. Waste time waiting & drag my time also.
The apps took tooooo long to open since the update. It hinder all my transfer since it need go secure and the page won't open even the homepage. Please fix it asap
Worst bank app service ever. Low maintenance and really annoying to handle such simple tasks. Buffer all the time and not even a message to inform in the app have problems to be fixed.
Apps Loading time during peak and non peak hours are terrible. If other banks's apps can be efficient in terms of loading time and etc, bank islam should make initiatives to develop an app that is on par with other apps. Show some class 😮‍💨
Your notification was so bad. No information regarding the need to upgrade, uninstall and reinstall. Your sense of urgency is so bad that you not allow customer to perform transaction right after installing the app. Instead, you asked for a cooling off 12 hours? Are you running a beta version on BIMB customer? You made 12 hours of misery.
I cleared app cache and data. Tried again. Its working. Thank you. Just that the tag that comes in into the phone only works at the second attempt.. not the first.
Bad experience, and looks like no improvement even though customers rate low. I think you should test your apps thoroughly. It is still the same even you have upgraded the version. Please be serious on improving your customer experience.
I am using this app since last 3 years. This is so frustrating. The App doesn’t work when you need it the most. I think the developers of this App are too lazy to fix the issues. Going to switch to another bank this week. Bye bye Bank Islam.
cannot use during payday week, most of the time hang during transaction,go apps becomes not go apps..the 1st version way much better than current. What a dissapointed experienced!
Its getting worse..i hope you guys can fix this problem..its already a couple of days but i still can't login to the apps..i always update the apps..but it's doesn't seem to be a changes at all..
Truly disappointed! After so many attempt trying to login with password still invalid! We only able to login with same password and username thru website using chrome browser. Please do something with your crash app!
Very slow. Every day I will uninstall and reinstall back. Than need to wait another 12hrs for transfer. Poor app. Why keep continue such services. Very sorry. Very frustrating.
The worst experience ever in all history of Online Banking app. This app is super slow considering how every user's bank account need verification from this app and yet it took forever to load. Such disappointment
The previous version is much better than now. I can't even log in to do my transaction and there's always error that I getting annoyed now 😑. Please fix it quickly
The latest mandatory update is full of bugs. I can't open it well especially when I need to transfer my money. The previous version is way better.
Please make an improvement to your apps, I'm very frustrated and annoyed each time to make any payments because this apps keep take a long time on loading page before going to login page. Please Bank Islam, do better.
The apps is not workable, lagging and not able to log in all the times, resulting in broken dateline and promises( so not islamic at all). Pls pls do something or do we need to report to PMX as well. It has improved and i m satisfied now
After updating still no improvement. After one transaction succsess, next transaction always failed. Always need to log out and delete cache, then can do the transaction. Becoming worst every year.
Can't login, at first didn't approved access, then as it is compulsory, allowed the access, but get error "Unable to connect to the server" Off, clear cached, still can't get through
i can't log in Go By Bank Islam (it said Invalid Credential) eventhough i updated to the latest version and my device is not old version, i told to the email (contact centre) and no response at all, please fix it ASAP, i need to use the app
Just recently update the app, and now i can't even open it😑 it says can't connect to server. Edited: thank you Bank Islam. I follow ur instruction. I delete my app and install it again. It worked
One of the worst app that I ever downloaded. I used to pay via fpx online but after the new update, I need to get permission from this Go app and sometimes it doesn't even work and after the latest update I can't pay to purchase something online💆‍♂️
Very inconvenient. Unstable and non worked app. Cant even open the app and just keep loading. I want to give negative star for this useless thing. Rework this disappointing thing.
Cannot access Tabung Haji even with latest update. App condition somehow as if it's an app made by a guy who just build their first app. It's bank app so with current performance, it's a disappointment.
Told me to use the app instead of website. But the app cannot even open. So how can I transfer and stuff. So disappointed especially during emergency...
Why does it keep buffering? I'm unable to make any purchases. Help please Latest: I've already updated it. Still the same, is it need a very good internet connection?
Please I'm begging you please update and fix the system..its been down with server error for weeks and this is not the 1st time. Sometimes it takes hours just to load -whattt??
Hi there, what has happened to this app, I can't log in even i tried many time. Previous version has better version than this new version. Please improve this kind of problem.
Unusable. App will stay on the loading page endlessly. Its been going on for months! Update 02/10/2023: Latest updates makes it even worse. Did you guys hire a bunch monkeys to manage this app? Didn't gave them enough bananas?
apsal app ni slow sgt.. Bi kena lebih improve customer service n satisfaction ni.. 4 app yg lain semua jauh lbh lancar. Once account freezed, and it keep repeating wrong password.. and u have to wait for 12 hours to make a transaction, this is nonsense service.. I'll better move to other banks..
Worst mobile apps ever. It didn't work properly and not even able to open it most of the time especially for Android user.
The app some time not available as before . The loading process take a several times. Some time i got fed up with this app. Please make it smooth like your take it money from us.
for many times, i try and try but still cannot login and of course it happens during the most urgent period. worthless apps!
Previous update was better than current. Dont know if there any maintenance, app and web both take more time loading and lag when enter it. Please make good your system
Just wanted to let the devs know that the app was not able to connect to the BIMB server after the latest update. I tried updating, clearing cache, clearing storage and nothing works. It only worked again after reinstalling the app. I loved the app but it will be even more amazing if the GUI is more fluid, though that's just me being picky. Hopefully the next update is smooth as it's been a recurring issue. Kudos to the devs.
Please fix the app. Sometimes it takes time to load, unable to connect to server but when accessing internet banking through the browser works just fine. A few times I had to reinstall the app just to fix the server error. It annoys me because clearing cache doesn't help at all to reset the connection to server. Why is that a problem? Basically the app becomes completely useless when the error starts popping up, reinstalling is the only option. We use this almost daily now.
Previous version apps are more batter than current apps. After I updated to a new apps the apps seems having a bad issues. 1. It is hard to open, and it takes more time to open. Loading too long. 2. Even though1 managed to log in, when I choose, as an example, to transfer a money, the apps will be loaded again, and it takes a long time to load. 3. Not so friendly like before, because when I would like to check other things inside the apps, the same issue happens. Please make changes

I cannot even pay using online banking due to problem service.
NOT USER FRIENDLY AT ALL!!! Last review, 1 star on December 2022, until today Nov 2024, this apps does not improve much. They include fingerprint to make the access easier, but not easy at all. I can easily access to see ny account with 1 time using fingerprint eith other banking apps, but not with this app. To open each section, it loading for so long. To get approval for transaction also take some time. What's the point moving to 5G era, but your app still slow.
for the past week I couldn't get pass the starting screen of the app and thus i can never access the app anymore. i have checked if there's any update but there were none and my phone meets the app requirement system. the web browser works fine but it is frustrating bc i can't use the app anymore to do instant transfers. fix this issue please this is too absurd
Cannot launch the app. Tried everything and yet the login page never appear, stucked at the front page forever. Read the latest reviews, and the developer keep on telling to update to latest version (3.2.09), which is what everyone already have update to, or use phone with android 9 and above. No solution or whatsover. Very disappointed with how little they care about clients' experience.
The app is so slow, and it will not open at all. I have to uninstall the app and reinstall it every time i want to use the app. After reinstalling, I can only use it once. The second time I try to use it, the same thing happens, and I will have to uninstall again. After reinstalling the app, I can't make any transfers to other banks for the next 12 hours. I feel like closing my account just because of this. This app is not convenient at all. In fact, it is troublesome to the users.
Too many errors occuring from time to time Either not being able to log in, not able to use the QR, and even worse, not even able to open the apps even after waiting for quite some time. Had to uninstall then reinstall the app. It is annoying as you need to enter your data all over again
PLEASE DO SOMETHING TO THE APPS!! after installed the updated version, it is always loading and stuck at the start up n i cant open the apps. Update on 28 oct 2023, i believe there is no improvement that bank islam done to their apps, which is super non friendly user, lagging, need to open and log in several times, i almost forget my password because rarely use it due to the issues.

Useless app !  Most of the time take time to load unable to connect to server. It's really frustrating. I had to reinstall the app when I need to do the transaction. Annoying !!!
i will close my account because if this incompetent app. now that you force to use app to validate any transfer but it does not even connect. i have clear cache, update, uninstall and reinstall before you even try to ask for me to update this app. even tried with wifi and my mobile 5G speed. this is just pure garbage of an app.
25/8/23: Guess I'm not changing my opinion anytime soon. Very, very rarely it was fast. Rest of the time? So slow that I forgot I have to pay for something. Now? I can't even go to the main page, keeps telling me to reinitiate transaction. WT--?? Like I have no life to live, is it, to wait for the app to actually work?
the most stupidest banking app.. it will take forever to load. on top of that if you want to perform duitnow transfer through the browser, you still need to open your go app. it's so annoying and it really makes me angry. i have very stable internet connection. Hey bimb please learn from cimb how to operate an app.
Unable to connect the server? Already update the latest version (as of 7 October 2023). Already uninstall and install again to see if it's working, but still doesn't working. If we need to call the center, every user of this app will end up calling Bank Islam. The problem is this app itself.
Very disappointing experience using bank islam go, it takes forever just to get to the log in screen, not to mention the problem while scanning qr codes and many more.. what's the point of yall taking RM 13 from our bank accounts if you didn't do anything to fix the goddamn app..no one will be furious if there is a slight inconvenience for a short period of time, but this app has been giving people nothing but trouble for quite some time..please step up your IT teams
Why i kept getting error "400 bad request", although i already key in my correct password and id also the tac number. After that error, the app send me msg that i already registered yet unable to to log in. Please resolve this, i already uninstall and reinstall for several time.. Dear BIMB, Again this app really needs improvement. As from all customers that seems to have the same issues, we really need you to solves it fast for us to used it again.
Please please please do stg about the app start up, I can't open the app no matter how many times I tried, and since some transcation require verification from this app it's really frustrating! Why in the world does everything need verification from the app anyway, the duitnow I get, the jompay I get, but why funds transfer too????
Sometimes it's working.... sometimes NOT. It continues to buffer. So unfriendly users. In fact my phone is new, install & uninstall 3 times by now & updated the apps to the latest version. But still the SAME prob reoccurring. Fix you apps pls!
Too slow, the app keep loading and in the end, the session expired just like that. One more thing... it keeps telling us to UPDATE BUT NOTHING'S CHANGED!! STILL THE SAME PROBLEMS OCCUR WHILE USING THE APP!! Please make improvement on the app so that IT WILL BE EASIER FOR US, THE USER OF THE APP!!
Often to unistall and install. Also been waiting for the IAC to be send to my number take years. Requested for so many times still did not received any In case of emergency to do any transaction, this is very much troublesome. Transaction via website also need approval from GO Bimb. How to if I can't even open the apps ?
I will be honest. This app is the worst. The loading takes too long for me to open the app. If its only a minute or two is okay but it takes 5 mintues or even more just to load? I've heard the issue is not new which proves this app is just that bad.
I've already updated to the new version but still couldn't open the app.. I don't know why it cannot connect to the server. I've tried using both wifi and data but still can't open.
Very bad apps.. Always stuck and nothing happened after wait 10 minutes. Causing me very bad experience to transfer money using western Union and PFX with your apps. Very very very bad!!!!
the apps are so bad, clear cache, etc, still unable to open the apps. Online transactions through the website need approval through GO secure, but nothing can be approved since the apps only trying to load the entire time
Took super long to open the apps. Most of the time i gave up. Would rather transfer all my money to other banks, easier when i need to do duitnow payment at the store. Im super close to stop using this app.
I mean i understand that many people are using this app, but you have to accommodate good service to them. Make frequent maintenance, if u already did u have to make it even more frequent. Please people are just trying to get their transactions through and if u are wishing to keep them as customers, please improve.
Frequently got problem to share the transaction receipt. There are 2 ways to share receipt in GO apps .... thru (menu) history mobile transaction or thru individual account transaction history. Both got blank receipt. My phone OS is Android version 13. GO apps version 3.2.09.
The app was very very veryyyyyy slowwwwww!!!!!! Couldn't make any transactions with this app. I am beyond disappointed. Edit: after the recent update, there's no more slow loading so i think they deseve more star
i want to carry out fpx transaction. so i need to use go app to approve the transaction. and goes on loading till the last 120s of the transaction. and when i got at the login page press go secure to approve the transaction. it repeatly tell me the transaction has expired, when i still have 120s. i did a few more time with the same result till transaction have really expired. ok i give another go, i reinstall the app, reregistered it for 3 more time to do the fpx and it still waste my time
From bad to worse. It was already laggy and slow before. Since the update, takes close to forever to load(my internet is running at 500mbps) . And the interface is very buggy. I can't do any transactions just an endless loop of returning to the home screen. I end up using chrome or my PC for any online transactions. Please this app really needs a major update & revamp. At a time when most things are online you might loose more customers bcoz other app(bank) are better
If there is an option to give 0 star, damn sure I'd give it without hesitation. Every time updates coming this app has become much much worse than before. Please fix your app and your server so we can log in without issue. Fix the damn issue asap or else we will port to another bank.
Half an hour loading to open the apps. Very very very bad apps for such a big finance company. Please let us used the browser instead of this app.. I repeat.. Very.. Very....very very.. Bad and junk apps.
I hate this app ever.... From September until the end of October, this app can't perform well even i have updated it... I can't do anything to my money in the bank. Already made some reports via email and call centre for this issue. Seem like no action from them.
Not intuitive to use. I cancelled my transfer settings and press OK on the dialog option, nothing happened, not even to the homepage. I tap on back button and the app not responding at all. Can't even find ASNB account summary or related (not transaction) but the bank have that service, really not good. Edit: No error, I wrote "Nothing happened" means I got any feedback from that? No, you didn't code any error message. That's even worst.
Unable to login,Already clear and uninstall the app.Still get the same error. There is no more,Go secure for approve transaction purpose.It is very dangerous since no safety in online transaction. YES,this is the latest version of app.
Worst app ever exist! Very slow and u need to activate go secure even for small amount transfer. Waste of time!! Once lag, it's going to lag forever.. in the end, need to uninstall and install it again. No improvement despite people giving reviews. Don't bother to create an app if it's only cause trouble every time u need to use it!!
My rating for this app has plummeted significantly lately among financial apps that I've used. Worst experience and seems buggy, it hangs frequently and randomly unresponsive, not able to connect, etc. Not easy for online payment. Getting tired of all sorts of issue for a financial apps from a Bank. Really needs to buck up and hope security is no compromised though!
Greetings to whom it might concern. You are a bank institution. There supposedly should not be any crashes, trouble opening, and unable to connect to the server every time. Please do something about this. I am so tired of having to close and open the app every time I wanted to do transactions and approvals. Worst, re-installing for dozens of times. Thus, I had trouble making simple payments. I hope to actually use your banking app smoothly. I look foward to see some improvements.
I have no words for how much I hate this app. Recently updated, now my transfer limit can't be changed on the app. It's a different limit from the mobile site, and it's a ridiculously low limit that I can't do anything with. Uninstalling and reinstalling for the umpteenth time and hope (yet again) that this will fix the problem.
Im so proud of bank islam. Most of the time this app cannot work, always loading screen and server error. However, rather than solving this issue you guys have a great idea by making transactions approval using the go app. So if we successfully log into the portal using web browser, we still need to open the app which is 99% does not work. What a fantastic idea! Btw, stop using AI to reply all reviews. Clearing cache wil not solve anything for this garbage system
Please upgrade your apps. Tells me to update, after updating the app, it says cannot connect to the server. Need to uninstall and re-install. Tired of doing the same thing all over again...if i can give u zero star, i would. Worst banking app ever. I don't know how many times already i uninstall and reinstall your app. Don't tell me about phone spec, never encountered this problem on any other banking app. 😤
Worst ever online banking app I've ever experienced. After having to install, uninstall and reinstall, it still failed to function. Doesn't even deserve 1-star. Please buck up!! and emulate other banks' secure app that have been proven to perform, no need to reinvent the wheel, just get it sorted out before imposing on customers to use such app for our online banking transactions.
App not responsive to touch input on landing/login page. Uninstalled and reinstalled still unresponsive, cannot tap 'get started'. Hope can fix soon.
Actually not bad if you compare with other bank software. User friendly UI, Easy to use, just abit slow sometimes. Other all good for me.
After update, cannot connect to the server. Need to uninstall and install it again. Loading time too long when need to do secure pay, untill timeout. Not much improvement compare to other internet banking apps after a year from my last reviewed.
I can see this app is improving. My only complaint is that it would be nice if this app would let guest user login using the app that already has a registered user ID. Sometimes, I'm helping my mom doing online transactions when I was at hostel, so it was troublesome to deregistered my Go bank account just to use Go secure using my mom Go bank account.
the app just updated and now i can't even make it to the login screen because of "server error". it's a pain and i need to use the app for online and cashless transactions, do fix this problem ASAP
too many bugs,slow apps eventhough signal at the area in good condition, need to improve on the apps efficiency,unable to screenshot as a evidence while performing any transaction.

Just recently update the app, and now i can't even open it😑 it says can't connect to server. Edited: thank you Bank Islam. I follow ur instruction. I delete my app and install it again. It worked
One of the worst app that I ever downloaded. I used to pay via fpx online but after the new update, I need to get permission from this Go app and sometimes it doesn't even work and after the latest update I can't pay to purchase something online💆‍♂️
Very inconvenient. Unstable and non worked app. Cant even open the app and just keep loading. I want to give negative star for this useless thing. Rework this disappointing thing.
Cannot access Tabung Haji even with latest update. App condition somehow as if it's an app made by a guy who just build their first app. It's bank app so with current performance, it's a disappointment.
Told me to use the app instead of website. But the app cannot even open. So how can I transfer and stuff. So disappointed especially during emergency...
Why does it keep buffering? I'm unable to make any purchases. Help please Latest: I've already updated it. Still the same, is it need a very good internet connection?
Please I'm begging you please update and fix the system..its been down with server error for weeks and this is not the 1st time. Sometimes it takes hours just to load -whattt??
Hi there, what has happened to this app, I can't log in even i tried many time. Previous version has better version than this new version. Please improve this kind of problem.
Unusable. App will stay on the loading page endlessly. Its been going on for months! Update 02/10/2023: Latest updates makes it even worse. Did you guys hire a bunch monkeys to manage this app? Didn't gave them enough bananas?
apsal app ni slow sgt.. Bi kena lebih improve customer service n satisfaction ni.. 4 app yg lain semua jauh lbh lancar. Once account freezed, and it keep repeating wrong password.. and u have to wait for 12 hours to make a transaction, this is nonsense service.. I'll better move to other banks..
Worst mobile apps ever. It didn't work properly and not even able to open it most of the time especially for Android user.
The app some time not available as before . The loading process take a several times. Some time i got fed up with this app. Please make it smooth like your take it money from us.
for many times, i try and try but still cannot login and of course it happens during the most urgent period. worthless apps!
Previous update was better than current. Dont know if there any maintenance, app and web both take more time loading and lag when enter it. Please make good your system
The app almost always show error, saying gobank experiencing high volume traffic. Very hard to do online transaction which will need to use go secure.
Please upgrade you apps. Very slow. Unable to do transaction especially paying bill etc.. Thinking to migrade to other bank if no action taken to solve the problem
Struggle to access. I had reinstall for 5th time a day. It's very hard to access. Just used website. Please fix the problem. It's make us not happy with this latest version. Actually, time to time, this apps could be easy and friendly to use. Hopefully, please go through for this problem first. This is the major problem from the others. Thank you.
Developer's please improve more on your apps . Always being freak all the time . Waiting too long to log in . Please la find a better or more high intelligence IT artist for your apps like the other bank . Not make user easy but burden them .
4 Oct 2023: Everything goes smoothly for now. Still can improve the UI. Thank you to everyone involved. Up to 4 ⭐
I love the app although they have problem loading quite a lot. I use it mainly because i connect it to the tabung haji. But i cant do it anymore. Why is that?
Transfer all my money to bimb because i lost my Maybank card. Now i cannot do any online transaction due to this app keep on loading till kiamat. Damn very sucks. Why need approval from this app when your system very bad. Nak beli makanan pon cannot pay using qr pay
Seriously this apps is too slow!! I can't perform a simple money transaction due to the apps just loading itself and I waited for a whole 30 minutes just for the apps to open!!! Even tho it's like that it seems like there's no improvement from the developer to upgrade their application performance... seriously a horrible experience for a cashless person like me.
Very bad application. server always down. Error communication with server. Lag too long. Application did not have user-friendly. Any update did not change anything but make it worse. For technical issue, always be late and too long for maintenance. Suggestion: please improve your server, make staff trained very well for apps, do some testing apps before release it. If apps always crash, make sure ask opinions from another.
Srsly, this system must be improved. I am thinking bout changing my service bcs of this. A simple transaction bcome complicated as h*ll. Byk sgt maintanance. Yeah, a system should be frequently maintaned but the frequency of this app being maintance is just too much and sometimes so abrupt .it bother the urgent transaction. Not only that,the application has tons of problem. Slow.
The worst online banking app. It took so long to just open the app. It will just keep on loading I need to wait for a very long time for the app to literally open for me to do my payment. I need to open the app super early if I want to use the app. There's no nice experience for me while using this app. I really hope that your technology/it team could rework or do something to make the app run smoothly. People has been talking about this problem since forever and I can't see any improvements.
If the App fails, at least makes it relinquish hold of the account. Else, one can get stuck not being able to access an account from either web client or mobile, effectively locking one out of his/her own account! Update: Reliability gets worser with every update. Daily transaction limit has mistakenly being changed from the basis of accumulated amount transferred daily to just a single transaction per-day. Might as well just close your account if you rely on mobile banking at this point.
The apps really bad. You want to make every transaction need to be verified by GO. But almost everytime I do a transaction the verification not pop up from GO apps and the GO apps always can't be open due to high volume. It's really really bad!! Please improve your system!
Please upgrade the apps. Loading time to open the apps is unstable. Sometimes it's working fine, sometime it took forever. Making it hard to perform transaction. Especially, when using Go Secure. I am able to receive notification from other apps while the apps loading for Go Secure. I believed it is not my mobile network problem. Please fix the issue. Online banking apps should be seamless as we are practicing cashless transaction for the norm.
This has to be the worst apps for a bank. You cannot even access and the page rotates like drops of blood oozing and oozing. Even using the website, as payment has to be made, when it transfers to the apps, the apps does not respond promptly until you have delayed payment in your waiting list. Unfortunately, has to be cancelled and switch to another bank service. This has to be the worst nightmare for Bank Islam customers. I would rate this apps zero star for incompetence, slow & irresponsive.
Deserves no star. Time is of the essence when it comes to financial transactions, but with this app constantly crashing, it defeats the whole purpose of having an app for financial transaction. Don't introduce an app if it cannot serve it's purpose. What is the point of me having to approve online banking transaction on the go app if the go pp constantly crashes??? No transaction can go through? Just stick to the code being sent to your phone???
Dear admin, please fix your bugs in this app ASAP. The latest update makes everything worse. I can't even open the app, and I can't even transfer online banking at all. If the app isn't gonna get fixed, it's hard for the users to proceed online transaction. I've tried uninstalled the app and reinstall it back but still the same. So pls fix the bug as soon as possible.
Very annoying. It take a longer time to open the apps. After waiting for so long, the server down and unable to access it . Unhelpful and terrible services . Looks like i may have to uninstall it and change to another bank.
This current version apps are very bad than previous. After I updated to new apps, i having a lot problem to login to do transactions. Its take more times to open because it loading too long. Not so friendly like before. Please do something about that, otherwise you will lose so many customer later. Thank you
29th Jan 2022: GO apps keep loading for quite some time. I've updated my password and even try to reinstall it. But still the issue doesn't resolved. I've been calling customer service/support to identify what's the root cause. Can anyone from IT team able to solve it? 26th June 2023: It getting worse. Seriously it getting worse. Loading time, response time after key in password, transferring money as well (during OTP seems faster), now approving via Apps took a lot of time. Really frustrating
Very frequent system hang. Then I will have to uninstall and reinstall back. Pls improve system reliability and stability. Tq 23 June 2023 Still no improvement with the apps. I still have to uninstall and re install every single time I want to access the Go apps. Worse now it says I can only do transaction 12 hours after! 3rd time already. And you can guess when I try to login after 12 hrs, the apps will just flicker forever and I have to again uninstall and reinstall back. Pls revamp the app.
Actually the app don't deserve ay star at all, I can't even log in despite connected to wifi. The system always lagging and crash, even I'm trying to transfer to my own account. The latest instructions want to encourage the user to use GO apps for any transactions but sadly, the GO apps getting worst without trying.
The app has been working fine for a few weeks but now it suddenly keeps saying to the traffic is high, all the time. And i suddenly have a limit for interbank transfers which doesn't make sense. Just please hire a good team to sort out all these issues.
Worst app ever. Does not even start. And it's supposed to be an authticator!???? Please fix this. I cannot do important transactions because of this!!
It takes yearsss to load. I need to approve a transaction and it takes forever to open the apps. Please do something about this.
Very bad apps.. always crash, hang up, missing favorite acc setting, exceed tx limit error, etc etc 😩👎👎👎...prev version much better...I am frustated during every end of the month when you need to pay a lot of thing..but hopeless... I will terminate my bank account soon (fyi, i am acc holder since 1993)...bye bye
Took forever to launch and it is not user friendly. Admin needs to respond to this matter and find better solutions to improve customers' experiences. An app is supposed to make things easy, not the other way round. Worst service ever. I can't believe that the developer doesn't even bother to address the customers' feedbacks on the app/service performance
Loading more than 1 minute!!! Latest update but nothing changed. Still take a long time to open this app. If I need to do any online transaction😌 then need to get approval from this app, its really not help. I literally spend 2 hours sometimes just to make sure I can make online transaction. High traffic and loading whatsoever are not a joke when the online transfer time only 100+ seconds. Please do improve your apps. It supposedly secure and easy to use. Not just secure and unusefull.
The worst banking app ever. Took forever to login, always buffering. Cannot detect fingerprint and keep on error when logged in by password. Things get harder whenever I want to make urgent transaction. PLEASE do something about all this problems. It is inconvenience in so many ways
worst app ever. it took more than 5 hours to get the receipt of transaction. been loggin in and out. installing and uninstalling. still no improvement. please fix. should deserve no star at all. tired of complaining. same excuses all the time. how much time do you still need to fix this app? it takes forever for you to try to fix this thing is it? and still, no changes ???🤷🏻‍♀️
This app is a mess, cant do anything smoothly. Please improve your server. I cant access it 80% of the time. Even online transfer using computer is a hassle because the final authorization is through the app which you cant access most of the time.
I cannot even log in at all. I only have this bank and turns out its the worst. Someone needs to fix this app. The app said the IAC is sending me verification code but i didnt receive anything??? Whenever i wanna do online transaction and it asked me to confirm through GO as the final step, I CANNOT GET THROUGH. ITS SO FRUSTRATING. GETTING ON MY NERVES.
So technically cannot use anymore is it? I need to pay my college fee, and it requires confirmation from this app. How do i even do that, this app hasn't worked for almost a year
Slow and annoying...try to open the apps but it keeps on loading till hours, thus delay the validation process of a payment or transaction.
I can't use it everytime I try I just server error( unable to connect to the server) But other people can I already reinstall the app update my phone it still not working
Trash apps. If you want to force people to use apps for online payment, make sure it works in the first place. Crash, cannot login, taking ages to try 1 transaction. I hasn't managed to complete a single transaction since being forced to use the apps.
Not a good option if you want to use this apps as your main account. It takes forever to load for login. I have uninstall and reinstall again. Still the same problem. Better to have another account which has more user friendly mobile apps like MAE or CIMB. Today 20/9/23 still same problem. These comments mean nothing perhaps.
I usually use mobile browser to make transfer in Bank Islam. But now you put another filter as in to approve transaction in this GO app. It's good on paper, because another security authentication is always good, BUT THIS GO APP IS ALWAYS UNRESPONSIVE. Imagine a simple transfer takes nearly an hour just to be responsive. Shame on you. It's 2023 but this app likes like it was build in 90s. And NO! I will not reach you at the email given. Step up your game or you'll lose many more users like me.
I recently used the Bank Islam Apps, and it left me thoroughly disappointed. The app's slow performance led to frustrating delays, leaving me waiting embarrassingly outside a restaurant. Adding to the frustration, I was informed that I had to wait a staggering 12 hours before I could make a much-needed money transfer. It was an emergency, and the app failed to provide a timely solution. In desperation, I resorted to using the website, which thankfully worked fine
The system experiences delays until it times out, in Islam is sinful to kill people , this app leads people die fast due to stressful using the app. Therefore, it's essential to invest more in bandwidth. Additionally, there was a security flaw in Duitnow that allowed a hacker to empty my account yesterday
Getting worst, cannot open. Please fix it asap. Cannot transfer or doing anything online. Bodoh punya apps. Still same problem after update. Stupid. Ur apps terrible
After update new version, cannot log in..loading too long..waste my time to do any transactions..so disappointed. Please fix this problems.
I've had quite a frustrating experience with this app. Picture this: you're in the process of confirming a purchase, and you're given just one minute to do so. However, the app takes an eternity to load, and when the time finally runs out, all the items in your cart disappear, forcing you to start the search all over again. It's a situation that leaves me truly disappointed, and I believe Bank Islam should take this feedback seriously. What a shame.
Very slow and unresponsive when selecting several features within the app. Looking forward for improvements in the near future. I expect it to be as good as CIMB clicks app
Mandatory but annoying whenever we need it the most. It lags during online transactions and multiple attempts at reinstalling often leads to confusion. The old ways were pretty much better.
Technology is getting more sophisticated. But this application is still outdated. Please.. Make the maybank2u example always up to date
Such a stressful life using this app. Always problem to log in, very slow server, and even I had uninstall and re-install this app almost 10 times. Sometime this app recommend to use internet banking if this app was in high traffic, but same thing happened. Is hard for me almost all the times whenever I want to pay for ptptn, bill, online payment just because of this app. Overall, this app very not helpful at all. Is makes me stress out even more.
If u want us to update for a better version, make sure that this application is not slow and always loading, I'm tired with this apps, newer but slower version, so what the point of updating if all this things the user need to exprience? Please keep maintaining your apps for better version, fix it asap!
Current version not user friendly. Always have an issue when try to log in and take time to load. The apps keep down whenever we try to open. Please help to fix this. Very difficult for a user to use the apps.
Simple, yet full of features. Unfortunately, not 5-star as it's sometimes difficult to access.
I would give 0.5 star only If I can. This app so worse and complicated to use. It's very sensitive about the security maybe and always got some problem, trouble, issue etc and ask us to go to bank, email the bank or call bank to fix it. Other bank is better because it's easy to use unlike this app. Always give us problem even though we use it politely
The previous version is much better than the latest one. The apps even cannot open anymore. Always lag and not responding. I even can't log in the account. This is upset cause i cant make any online transaction and check the bank account details.
Please fix and do something. I don't know what happened here. Every time I use this app, it shows the 'server error' on the screen 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
Unable to open the app. The app keeps loading for 5mins+. Cannot do any online transaction within the app.
When using scan qr function, there is no dot (.) when you want to make payment. So can't make payment if cents is involved.
If its possible, no star at all. Downloaded the apps because cannot continue with the transaction using the website, then the server keep on "unable to connect to server". U want people to use your apps, like PBe MAE, but then the apps is not working. How come? Many people comment already, no action taken meh? Very poor. Better no apps. Just back to the kampung style. Sigh
WORST APP EVER. Taking forever to load. If you still want to use 'ISLAM' as a brand, kindly improve the app to be more efficient and reliable. It is very embarrassing to see 'ISLAM' attached to a poor, terrible, and pathetic app.
Got an update, cant log in,.. reinstalling and after all registering it ask me to wait 12 hour, and when i do i still cant load the log in screen.. The biggest dissapoitment ever.
please do something bank in should be more easier. I tried to open this application for almost one day. it can be open.. can be impatient. It takes too long to open. Too many time to install unistall. On off the phone.. high traffic it's can't be related. Urgent transaction make a worse experience.
your team have make an improvement to the apps, much better and faster,please make it better. good job.
Edited as 28/11/22 : Only can login after new installation, and the same error still occur on the second,third,4th login you name it. APN_TSN_500 please fix that, or you guys seems working on new app ? Wanna to abandon this one really bad arent you? Edited as 7/8/23 : After a years away, decide to try the app back, now i can say its much better and no pop up error no more. But you are a big name companies, problem like this shouldnt take 1 years to be fixed. Change my ratings to 5 stars
After the update, now the application can be open smoothly without any stuttering or loading problem. Thank you developer!
This app request to update new version to open it but only load for so long and can't even open the app. So bad!!
Really bad comparing to last time. Before upgrading the security, using the TAC is just fine because I can proceed with my PC. But now it requires SecureLogin and then the app is lagging as hell + unable to load. What a waste of time
This is why I hate every single of Malaysia Apps, one of it because, too slow, yeah loading too slow, even sometime the app crash or error. How do you even create this app like a crxp? I want transfer or pay and sometimes the app have a problem, please improve your apps, you want a better rating, improve.. Not just replying and said tq for support and any problem pls report blah blah blah.. No, we don't wanna hear that, we just only want you to improve, that's it
One of the worst app ever. Why? Because you cant even open the app. They dont give you TAC number anymore to your mobile. You need to approve it from the app when you want to make the transaction. But how do i approve it if i CANT EVEN OPEN THE APP??? The worst app ever!!
The old version allowed me to make loan payment even it is joint account unlike this version. Need to make payment via web..so much trouble just to pay my housing loan. This new version also does not allow to take screenshot which I think will be much help to me when I make complaint (as attachment). Useless !
I have poor network condition in my area. When i wanna topup using mydigi. Then for the next step to approve transaction , i need to open apps to approve it. During the approval, the app cannot load due to poor network. After that incident, i cant open the apps because it always popup the approval for transaction then always popup error. What do i have to do to make the apps working properly? I have reinstalling the app but the issue is not yet solved.
Worst app ever. Entered the correct login details yet was blocked. To make it worse I cant even reset my password. It keep looping either at the same page or saying cant connect to server. Seriously, the worst app I have ever used. DO NOT INSTALL!!
It took too long to log in after latest update😠😠😠 After update to latest version,still it takes too long to log in even my phone is already operating in version 13
Dont know what is the problem always exceed limit when i want to make a transfer . Worst apps ever. Better dont have to use app.
Very bad, slow and the apps doesn't even open. Dah la urgent nak bayar student fee, apps pulak lambat tak boleh buka. Even dh uninstall and reinstall balik apps pun still tak boleh buka juga. Please fix the apps
Why it always pop out"can't connect to server" it always happens.it wasn't my connection it all about this app. Please fix em'. So annoying me.
So many issues with the apps. Need to install and uninstall so many times. Least favourite banking app.
Hi. Sorry for the review. Actually it is my mistake. After reading carefully, there are two type of app, 1 is GO, another 1 is GO BIZ. I install the GO BIZ and wondering why I cannot login. Turns out it is actually for business account, which I dont have. Then I install the correct one, which is GO, and I can login now and everything working fine. So I edit back my review and give the app 5 star as I'm very satisfied with the app sp far. Sorry again for the confusion.
just shut down the app if you guys can't handle it 🤷🏻 buat app simple simple sudahlah Fix your stupid app, the app always buffers when entering ALL THE TIME I HAVE TO WASTE MY TIME WAITING FOR THIS APP TO OPEN
Not really work during peak hours. As banking application, it should be able to support higher traffic especially during peak hours. It will be good if IT team can improve the apps ability to handle traffic
ISSUES ALL THE TIME, DELAYED IN OPENING THE APP. which is a huge problem when i wanted to make any transactions in store. Will move to other banks after this. Really bad service. Came back to edit my review, still bad. Much worse. I cant look at my transaction history, have to reload many times. When i say many, more than 10times. So yeah, I don't use the app anymore. I transfer all my salary from bank islam to my other bank straightway after receiving them 😤🤌
As usual this apps are never fail to disappoint me. I want to open it but its just freeze. I cannot log in it. The only successsful thing for this unreliable apps just to frust the users with its uses. Even before log in. The this apps is freeze. So as a compliment i congratulate the developers for developing this incompetent apps for the users.
This app can't working since a few months ago. I have try all methods that have been taught, but the problem is still remain unchanged. I'm using Redmi Note 9s which still Android Version 10. So I hope that this issue will be solve as soon as possible. Thank you.
If you all have issues with unable to connect the server, try uninstall and install it. Hope it helps!
i agree with everyone here. Worst app, slow, and hard to make transaction. stop replying with "we're sorry" and start making improvement. for the meanwhile let us just use the web and TAC instead like before. much easier. you want to make it more secure but the main problem is your apps are getting worst and worst. pleasela fix.
Please improve your service bank islam. This apps should be usefull for everyone cause nowadays everything can be manage by using phone. You're one of the best bank i think that i have use but your apps oh god please improve this! Do something!
Very useless and non-reliable application. Always stuck at the starting page. Have to install and reinstall to make it work, then after some time it will fail again. I don't know who Bank Islam appointed as the developer, including their IT team but they definately non competent and failed big time.
Worse ! Very frustrating! When I need to pay for online shopping, it needs to be authorised on the Go Bank Islam app. When I open the app, it takes a long time to load. After I enter the number and do it, even after the screen shows done, it doesn't pay for the items I need at the online shopping apps. Please improve these. When I deactivate my Go Secure and pay for my online shopping, it still wants to be authorised by the Go Bank Islam app. So, please improve this also. Thank you.
Alhamdulillah... GO by Bank Islam has gotten better since its downside recently and provided an improved online app banking experience for its users. It is functioning better than ever. Thank you very much Bank Islam!
The app keeps on loading in the front page, can't even log in. Very inconvenient. Needs to uninstall and install it back for thousand times cuz it keeps on crashing. Very not recommended when needed to use it in rush.
Why is it taking longer and longer to load the apps??? 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ Developer of this apps should fix it. It's inconvenient. Everytime I want to pay QR, I have to wait for hours. Most of the times I have to say sorry to the cashier and I have to waste my car's oil to go to the bank!!! What's the use of online banking if it is unusable???!!!!
Forever causing difficulties when needed. Forever high traffic, forever cannot procees, forever cannot read finger print & forever making me like a fool when need to pay or transfer at counters or shops. When call for report, the only answer u guys can give is still in the process of developing to give better experience. Nowadays, never have i ever had the experience of logging in only once to just to complete an easy task such as checking my balance. Must at least 3-6 tries before successfull
I am getting error unable to connect to server since the latest update. Such issue shouldn't happened for a banking app.
first time using this application, it went smoothly but the next log in, this app asks me to register again, but when I want to register, this app always can't perform, the answer is always given,"400 bad request","unable to connect the server"," high traffic","server error"...this app does not cooperate and cannot be used because it always asks to be registered...this app is not work ￼
Hi, please make the app very convenient because it really not helpful at all. To transfer or make a transaction, the loading are to long like there are no connection. The website version more convenient & fast than this app, even you successful to log in doesn't mean you transaction will make it on time. Don't link the web transaction confirmation to the app right now. Please bank islam I've being your customer since in college & now I'm 30 don't make it useless make it smooth & fast
The app is slow because it needs a strong Internet connection. That's all. Suggestion: 1. Update the UI app to more fresh one following the trend right now (Be U can, why the official app cannot right?) 2. Make a more friendly user UI, not old school one, bold & not interesting UI.
I don't understand why the app is getting worse after each updates. Online transaction can only be done/approve after approving it via app but app keeps on crashing and it said 'need to reinitiate new transaction'. When new transaction was initiate,the same thing occur again. Then it said new transaction can only be done after 12 hours. Kindly improve the app and fixed the bugs as I never encounter this issues with other bank's app.
Please make this app going faster and smoothly. It took me 10 minutes just for entering. Sometimes server busy and not responding ☺️. It is better using official website then the app. Feel too much irritated due to loading. Even after loading some of the transaction is late updated. And sometimes the available balance and current balance is not merge amount making me confused.
the system always slow went i want to used it to pay anything with qr and it keep say no connection but my line or connection are in good condition.
you gotta be kidding me- i've been using bank islam for a while now and tell me, why is there server error keeps happening every time despite i was having a really good internet connection, especially if i want to make IMPORTANT transaction????? i wish i can give zero stars for this app because it gets progressively worse over time and i see no improvements AT ALL for the past few years since i opened the account
Why the apps always out of server? It's kinda annoying when it happen! It's prevent from doing transaction! I hope you can fix it as soon as possible. It's always the connection problem. Why? Hope this will be fix!!!
Apps stuck hang! App still having the same problem. Loading to long, tried uninstall and installed back still facing the same problem year ago today still facing the same problem. What does this company do for improvement actually. Other banks already making it easier for customers but this company still no changes. Shame carrying up big name for bank name.
Very frustrating. Update, uninstall, reinstall, clear cache a few times still not working. Shud change to other bank now
Literally one of the worst banking app to ever exist. Don't even bother downloading. I'm on the latest update and the app seems to be stuck on that annoying "loading" screen whilst I'm on an important affair. It's 2023 and the app still has major performance issue. Not to mention the horrible UI design. Bank Islam needs to fire whoever is in-charge on maintaining this app.
SO SLOW THAT I CANNOT GET ANY PAYMENT DONE WITHIN TIME LIMIT. since they don't give TAC anymore, i have to approve payment through the go app but it takes forever to load the screen. one time i got a 20 minutes time limit to finish a payment. the whole 20 minutes. THE WHOLE 20 MINUTES. THE SCREEN WAS STILL LOADING. PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS IT MAY HAVE DISRUPTED SO MANY OF YOUR USERS' BUSINESS.
The most useless apps in the phone.not a friendly user apps since it's take too much time to open it (always shows high traffic volume while the user's internet connection are good..better upgrade your apps as soon as possible.
What the hell with your apps, it's getting worse day by day, i don't know what type of system that u've been used, it's seem so bad and always not function., Do something with your system, take a look and try at least to improve your system, i thought with apps more easy, but end up it's make me more miserable then before, you guys have to do something about that, try follow like maybank2u, more easy and friendly user..
STUPID APP!!!!!!! everytime server error, loading take a very long time. how to make online transactions if you cannot even go into the first page. it should be name as NO/CANNOT GO APP instead..better changing to other bank.
Please do something with this app. Transection cannot go smoothly. How many time have to uninstall and install back.
Please fix the loading issues on this app, I am restarting this app for 10 times and I still couldn't get through.
Frustrated. Almost every time i want to use the system always down. Please improve it.
Can I know why I use Celcom data(I don't test others brand data) cannot use Go Bank Islam? When I try using wifi, the app smoothly open which have no needed pending a very long time. I try watch yt on 1080p using a data, the speed is okey no slow. Please fix this horrible situation because I was on the hurry to use Go BI but can't open it. If something emergency I cannot rely much on this Go Bi. Other than that, please make bank islam look more user-friendly because it's hard to use.
Almost every time need to delete the app and relogin to access to the app. Pls fix the login problem.
I want to open the app, it takes a long time to load..then I want to transfer money, it loads again..then it is denied.. after that i must to delete the app, then download it again.. open the app, it loads again, then it is denied and I have to wait 12 hours to make the transfer.. the same thing happens over and over again.. please do something & improve your services..
Please USE MAYBANK M2U programmer to make this app better. Really hard to open, even to check my balance. When i want to make transfer, app showing error, but money already transferred. Very frustrated. This is about security & people money. Please making big change for ur banking system. Dont just keeps updating without any different. 0 star to u guys
The new online transaction where it requires this "very well made app" is such a great idea from them as I would need to face the buffering, 200 seconds when there's problem with the app, error 500, reinitiate the transaction and much more :). I had such a blast using this app!!!!:)))))))
Worst app ever. It is supposed to make things easier, but this app makes things harder. Always took a very longggggg time to launch, always high volume of traffic. Wasting so much time waiting this app to launch to make a single transaction.
It says wrong server, wrong connection then I uninstall & install the app again it become worse.. App keep loading.. Please do something..
Please fix this app ASAP, i've been uninstalling and installing this app countless time, everytime wanna use it, I can't even open it. It just keep on loading and doesn't let me ues it. Not only me, some of my friends and family face the same problem.
The most ridiculous bank app I've ever had to use. The thing just keeps loading for eternity on the welcome page! I can't even do online banking with my Bank Islam account because of this! WTH
TAKES TOO LONG TO LOAD. Please take action and fix this app. Making it difficult for users to pay and check the balance. It seems that not once or two users sound about this problem,but your party still does not make reforms and improve the problems faced by all of us.
THE WORST BANKING APPS EVER. This apps doesnt deserve any star at all. Very slow response. This problem has been addressed for so many times but it seems like there are no initiatives at all from the developers. If you dont want to improve your apps then dont bother create one. Will definitely switch to another bank
Need to get started after update. But after key in IAC number, it's loading until forever. Do it 3times but still same, even already received sms said done register go apps. Buying new phone to make sure using latest android version. Still same. Usually open in website. But right now want to have approval in go-secure. So, cannot do any transactions.
What is wrong with this app?! Its getting worse than the older version this is so time consuming. It keeps loading way longer than expected. I cant do my online transaction if this keep going on. Do something about this IT management or whoever in charge for this apps. Because this app is so disappointing.
Before the latest update i like this apps , smooth but after the update can't open the apps ' LOADINGGGGGGGGGGGGGĜGGGGGGGGGGG......plis fix this prob ASAP....TQ THE WORST BANK APPS SYSTEM I'VE EVER SEEN COMPARE TO OTHERS BANK APPS....
This app sucks, before this doesn't have any issue. Now after new updates i can't use it like before. The apps always crash, cannot log in, and now when doing transaction we need to use go secure and it need the apps to works in order to proceed but now the apps it self cannot open, then how i going to proceed with the payment?
Please disable the function which require customers to use this app for making transaction online, it cannot be use at all, especially when there is urgent need to transfer money. People may die somewhere because of this useless apps! I will consider to terminate my bank account if the issue still continue.
Very slow, difficult to open, please upgrade your service like other banks. Now I cant log in due to unable server🤬
App is so slow. Always have problem / Time Out while waiting for GoSecure to authorize fund transfer..
Bad. Everytime also cannot open. Always high volume. I need to uninstall and reinstall. Still cannot open. Lame. Now fully need to use gosecure what so ever, but to open, the apps still loading.
Previous is much better than new version or even worst.I could not do transfer after skip one time and pop up said it can be done after 12hr ??? What??? Bank islam please dont do this , you should be better with growing IT...
I think this is the 10th million times I had to uninstall and reinstall. Almost a year has passed and this still could not be resolved? It was such a nuisance when u have to do an urgent transfer but the gosecure couldn't be accessed as it took forever to load the page!!! Apa ni bank islam? Benda basic masih lagi sangkut?
worst app ever. so slow. always loading. it deserve 0 star. this problem has been happening or so long, was wondering if you ever want to improve this app?
Honestly I have no idea why I even bother still having the app, it is an effort in futility with how slow and the incomprehensible waiting time for it to open. It just like their management just want to be cursed by their users.
Very disappointed with the app. I don't know why I thought having all my money in this account would be useful. I've been trying to order my food online, and I couldn't do it as this app is not even turning on. I can't transfer in even from browsers. Haritu rasa macam dah okay sikit masalah ni, tetiba jadi balik. Tolonglaa be responsible with the app. It freaking holds our money, how should I believe this app if nak log in pon dah macam2 problem. Very embarrassing.
getting worse after the update. even a standard online banking would FORCE its user to open GoApp to authorise EVERY EFING transaction. This certainly causes unnecessary problem since I am the one who manage my family bank acc just from online transaction, totally away from home as a student. It it much easier before, but now, cannot anymore.
The app is worst! Only few times I can use my online banking without any problem, most of the time the server just doesn't seem to work. Nonsense! Please do something about this or else, do not have any apps at all.
I have updated the apps, but it is getting worse. I want to transfer to shopee, but fpx Bank Islam can't be used. Shopee history already stated as cancelled, but in the Bank Islam apps, the transfer is still reinitiated. After that, I can't open the apps because I keep mentioning "reinitiated transfer". Even after uninstall and install again, it still the same and can't be used.
this is the worst online banking app ever. It is always unusable. always under repair & log in takes a long time. I don't know what the problem is. every time I want to use it, I have to uninstall and reinstall it. please fix it. I can't stand it anymore.
It is good enough now. But still sometimes it will be stuck on the loading screen. Hope it can be better soon.
EDITED 25/6/23 : i thought it was getting better. Sadly, the smooth experience only last for 1 week. Now the apps is getting worst and slower than last time. Im planning on changing banking apps. 3 years and still no improvement. Please change your dev team / invest more on user exp.
Really bad experience. Too many times unresponsive, taking a lot of time loading and just now i can't even pay my bills because it has to be approved by unresponsive apps! You need to learn from Maybank or even MBSB, their apps are much better.
It don't work for open the apps n transaction. Please repair your apps!!! Why not allow to click apps this, aq geramm til lah baiki boleh tak?!
Good job, the application is better day by day. Keep improving, hope it'll be as good as it could be.
Already updated,but still have problem. cannot make a payment or transaction by using other apps
Selepas updated makin teruk loading dan over slow. Kenapa system apps bank islam menyusahkan pengguna? New prob APZ_TSN_500 unable to process your request. Still same when to open apps.
This app has been abysmally slow for the past months. It always fail to load past the circling loading animation. Not to mention my uni where i study use bank islam as main channel for financial services. But fortunately my uni has change to new RHB Bank. Please devs, fix your app ASAP. Update to dev : cache clear didnt help. I almost lose money when buying bus ticket using online banking bank islam. I was forced to use the app's Go Secure function yet the app fail to load past circle animation.
Previous version apps are more batter than current apps. After I updated to a new apps the apps seems having a bad issues. 1. It is hard to open, and it takes more time to open. Loading too long. 2. Even though1 managed to log in, when I choose, as an example, to transfer a money, the apps will be loaded again, and it takes a long time to load. 3. Not so friendly like before, because when I would like to check other things inside the apps, the same issue happens. Please make changes
It's faster than other bank's app that I've used. For now. BUT... I can't share the receipt nor can I screenshot them. When I clicked the share button, it's loading forever. It's troublesome.
It doesnt work lately. Infinite load screen, terrible lag. Its a shame becuz i really like the interface. Please keep performance in mind. Your web app works flawlessly, why the mobile app so bad?
The authorization thru the Go apps is really annoying, I only want to spend like rm20 thru fpx but I still need to authorize my transaction using the apps. I understand it will increase the security . But if the apps keep loading forever how can I even buy things online. I need to buy some food for my CAT!! AND THE APP KEEP LOADING FOREVER...MY CAT ARE DYING. WHY ARE YOU MAKING THIS HARDER FOR US 😭😭😭
This app keep getting worse every time I update. The "loading" getting longer whether still log in page or when I want to transfer. PLEASE FIX THIS. Supposedly when it updated, it getting better not otherwise.
I try to reinstall the app because its still in the loop mode for a long time. But after reinstall Ive to wait 12 hour to do duit now transfer. Instead trying to make it easier for us to do online transaction, it make we are keep waiting and harder to do online transaction. Such a nuisance!
Terrible app. Even ady update to version 3.2.10, even ady reinstall many times still cannot use the app.
The new update is really bad. If You want to transfer money, the app needed you to reconfirm in GO app, GO app took forever to load, in the meantime you have 180 seconds to confirm transaction through GO app thats still fail to load. I am really Disappointed. The worst experience ever.
Several problem occurred after recent update. Can't pay anything that need approval from apps and can't open the qr code
Slow connection. Unstable apps. Please improve for better performance. We are going for digital platform so need a better performance and easier for use.
Can not log in in the phone app. Keep loading. Very disappointed!!!!!!!
Poor services. Can't access apps due to high traffic, so need to use browser instead for transactions. Better use browsing rather than download this apps. Kindly test run the apps stability then only launch it.
I can't connect with this app. That's weird after updated. And always wanted update. Weirdo

very bad after update..everytime and everyday when i'm want to log in... still cannot log in and still everytime traffic issues..it's make me stress.. i like to throw my phone in the river everytime i log in this apps.... very2 stress... every time and everyday its very2 hard to log in... when it's really impportant to use.. but still cannot log in.. very bad apps right now. . after reinstall.. it's still cannot log in.. every minute traffic issue...its not good to use right now.. i hate this..
used to make online transfer from website but now it needs to get approve using the app but the apps is sooo slow. this is why I prefer using website rather than the apps. please fix it, I've been waiting for days and still to transfer my money from bank islam to another bank. don't make people's life hard, it's not good. so many complaints but nothing change.
Issues all the time, you will either face "unable to connect to server" or "high traffic" notice. Even though I have updated to the latest version and even reinstall the apps a few times, there's still no improvement whatsoever. Nonsensical. Update: if the app is only problematic for me, I may understand that I need to clear the cache or change to mobile data. But, when all the user are facing the same problem, it just shows that you have failed to provide a bare minimum for this app.

App becoming worst after the last update rolled out. Seriously slow, lagging, take long time for loading more than a minute, need to clear cache many times just to approve a transaction or get to login interface, and forever loading. Honest talk here, please do improve the apps. thank you
Very bad Apps. After updated, long long time for the loading. Please improve you Apps
Too bad.. took a veeerrrryyyy long time to access lots of hang, hard to trsfr. Bad apps.. need to improve more
Very unreliable apps , very hard to do transaction , i had to transfer all my money to other banks for better transaction procesess
the worst app ever. if your system cannot support the go secure feature, then better delete it. Just use the old tac method. Really wasting my time using this app. Need to go forth between this app and merchant app many time because the transaction cannot pass thru after the go secure step
It took so long to just open the app, keep loading, then after key in the password, need to wait again. Imagine if I use online banking payment, got long que in market, sure I'll get yell from other customers behind me. This is so slow. Bad experience. Needs to improve or I need to open new account bank and choose another bank instead (of course not Bank Islam no more)
I'm just give a single star because the process is too slow. And my money getting lost by itself without I use it. I'm not rich to sacrifice my single cents
Why keep saying to clear cache. How many times clear (lost counted) it still lagging and there's so many comments with same problem . Slow , lagging ,system down & bla.. bla..bla. Don't just respond to customers to convince them only, pls also solve the problem and find solution . Previously this apps not that worst .
can't open after updated the app,updated to the latest version (3 October 2023) still cannot open,android 12
Very slow for every loading pages, I wait for 5 minutes also nothing happen, please take this seriouly.
We know u trying your best to keep our fund save, but please if u guys always hold and updating the app for unreasonably period of time during peak weekends. It's no absolutely contengency plan from your side on how we need to dug our money for payment... Duhh... Maybe all BIMB branch is super high volume right now withdraw thier money manual for each payment.. if u guys not an expert in apps try hired some expert to do it right! It just took obvious.. too obvious... Same things always happen..
Response is slow as hell. While waiting for the loadings that appear everywhere in the app, I drove to Bank Islam (which is 30 minutes from my home) and performed the transaction. When I got home, it was still loading. Bravo to the developer.
Took lots time to make transaction. Sometimes failed to do it. Just loading...
"02-0005 INVALID CREDENTIAL"....I was locked out of my own account because the app always saying my credential is invalid even though it was fine when logged in via web. 🤬 Installed because the website forces to approve transaction via app, but the app says invalid credential. There should be a 'no' option because I hate the app. This app has major issue. 👎 Developer responds the same way as other critics in the review as if it was a bot replying. Google please take action and remove this app.
Worst ever apps. Lagging, loading, unable to ever enter the first page like 24/7. Apps should make life easier, but this is exactly the opposite way. Thanks to this apps, ill will never use Bank Islam again. Time to change to another stable bank.
Latest app version is super slow. Start to wonder if this app hasn't perform any performance test for the latest build. So frustrated. Cant perform txn coz stuck at splash screen when app launch.
Just please bring back the TAC no and no need GO secure for online transactions. It's suck when everything about the transaction need to go through the apps but the apps are so useless n loading. Why do you all doesn't have any backup plan for your customers? It's so annoying!
I think the previous App was better than now. Not only you cannot access the mobile app page, but when you want to make transfer of money, you need to access/get approval from the mobile app which cannot be accessed. How stupid it is....
Please do something, not reliable. Always facing 'non stop loading' when I want to tap for secure tac when transferring money
Very bad apps,very slow, couldnt ss.. too much time taken to be approved, managed.. hopefully you'll improve your system
pleasee repare the app . soo sloww . sometimes when im urgent wanted to transfer it takes so long to login
Cannot launching, sometimes meed to be wait. And the worst moment is when i need to make a transaction on web, they ask to approve by via app and the app cannot be open. So why do we need thiss app meanwhile it cannot be launching??? Please do something. It almost 3 years ive been used this and it still same like BEFORE
The worst bank I dealt with in my life: It doesn't work with my pixel 6, I can't even use my account on the website because ask me give approval on their app and app does not work.. what stupid poor service they doing, the email doesn't work also!! Plus many more other bad things....
Very Terrible. There's always something wrong with the server and traffic. Make it almost impossible for me to make any payment/money transfer. Annoying and took alot of time to recover. Sometimes, can't event get into the home page. Already uninstall and install the newest version but it become worst than i expected. Please make an improvement abt the app.
Very buggy and now i am unable to log in to my account due to it always stuck at the startup stating, "unable to connect to the server". While, some of my friends are able to use it like normal, but the other friends faced the same thing as me. Very slow in repairing it's bug and problem. Overall, it's disappointing to be honest.
After update the latest version, the apps seem having a lot of trouble..unable to do transaction smoothly.. cannot transfer money and taking more time loading and lastly it will logout suddently
I cannot login to approve my transactions from the web!!! Please fix the app!!! No more SMS TAC so your app is VERY important to function, login also not functioning!!! Update: Help was provided after contact and resolved my issue, bumped the rating stars for this
Please revert back the system to the old one. This new GO is a NO-GO. Not a user friendly at all. The apps keeps crashing and I cannot even log in to system properly.
Everytime update mesti bermasalah! Worst app ever!! Unfriendly, hassle and very irritating!! Transaction were all failed... menyusahkan hidup i! its been 3 days and in consecutive of everytime you all update the system!! What are you guys doing?! Takde usaha nak perbaiki masalah ni ke?! Shows your system and management terrible and weak!
Why this apps always problem? Either with wifi or data. Either bug or loading too long time, taking a very long time to open the apps, and many time 'under maintainence'. Already use this apps for more than 3 years. Please go for some improvements for this apps
2 days i cant log in. They say (unable to connect to server. Please fix this. Edit. ( now tabung haji cant open also).
Why this apps on 23rd until 10th every month can be used smoothly, always crash and need to reinstall back and set up all over again.. i have a bills to pay and i thought online banking are really helpfull my time.. but not on BIMB platform.. please fix this, i been using since 2018 until now same problem coming
Bank Islam app dosen't work at all. Everytime log in, it will take forever to load. The only way is to uninstall and re-install the app. Very inconvenient. In this age of online banking bank islam dont seem to be able to solve simple problem like this. Other banks have no issue on their apps. Very basic problems yet Bank Islam can't solve it. Dosent reflect the islamic or the banking status it deserve. Bank Islam customers are mostly B40 based that explains their typical "tidak apa" attitude.
What the function adding qr code scan system if opening the app take like whole hours to open and what the point to even exist if optimise too slow. Where the fund for the project to utilise and bring comfort and better and easy way if it keep failing us the customer. fixed you for sake of god app!
Unable to open at all most of the time, when u need to access account urgently, not a convinience place to save here
Getting worse. I'm using android ver 13. My internet line is 80-140 Mbps. I just bought new handphone. This is a global problem and not an isolated case. So why need any user that complain to contact the mobileapp when improvement has to be made at higher level. Don't be cheapskate and refused to invest for a better app developer
I can't do any transaction as they need an approval through the app..yet i can't even open the app. This is really frustrating. You should be aware that you've been receiving bad reviews the most. Hope you can fix this matter very soon!
I HATE THIS APPS SO MUCH!! I need to uninstall this apps for getting the secure LOL. Again and again. I am tried! PLEASE FIX IT! Learn from BSNsecure PLEASEE!!
Very bad experience. Try to pay for my korban since last night, even tried at 1am. but after filling up details, go bimb took very long time to show relevant screen then says no instruction for payment. Tried several times. Same experience until now. Who will bear cost - spiritual cost if i still cannot pay through bimb? Previous version much3 better.
Typical server problem. Always high volume of traffic. Fix this problem asap. There's lots of people using this app, and still no action taken. Please, fix this problem. Guna app, berpusing. Guna web, pun ikut pusing. Fix asap, or you'll lose customers/users faster than you realize.
I can use the app only once and then it crashed everytime i want to use the app.
The apps is very no responsive. When we urgently need to transfer fund, we cannot access the apps, when we use web browser ,the approval must via GO. How i want to access my money when i can access the apps??? Really disappointed. This never ending story.
The app refuse to open — even after I waited for long. I can't even see the login screen, merely those pink loading blob that irritated me. I'm not one to leave a bad review, but this is getting ridiculous. Judging by others reviews, I'm not the only one. Please fix this, it's hard for me to do stuff when I can't even access my own money.
Now we can't use website to transfer? It's asking me to go app but the app itself not working properly. Showing errors always, waited for so long but still showing like that. Thought it needs update, but no update available. Regret downloading it.
Can't login after receiving no from no phone it say bad request I already update this app but still same problems already update sign in put REQ registered but can't login
Very inconvenient. Couldnt login in the app and it said to use the web version. But when I tried to do a transfer, it said to use the app to approve the payment. I wish there's an easier way to use Bank Islam.
Shittiest bank app in Malaysia. Cannot even open because it is so slow. Ugliest interface too.
very awful apps...lagging and lagging and lagging. I really wonder whether any QC or improvement done for this apps. totally frustrated use. The share button hardly any use whenever we want to share proof of transaction. please do some job!
Everytime I need to use online transactions this apps keep on alert server not available. So then I need to uninstall and then install again. Why this keep happening. Can you create a better functional apps to ease the customer.
I had operating system above 9, but why the app did not function. Everytime I open the app, it stated unable to connect to the server. There so many things I need to pay through this app. Please help me.
This is my first time using this app and it it the worst. I already had problems using it and now i facing the connection problem i have a stable connection but the app said it is untrusted connection. What does it mean?? Please fix it immediately
The worst online banking apps..Not convinience to use because always stuck at front page or loading time took longer whenever want to check balance or make transanction using this apps. Kindly upgrade it..
cant do internal transfer for my investment account and savings account anymore, it says exceed limit. there was no problem before, please fix this, already updated the limit,but still the same
Why when using online banking from web browser quite fast, but thru app can't connect to the login? Using different server or the app's connectivity very bad? Please fix it as some transaction need to go through Go Bank app.
Suck and hard to get access. When require fast transaction in any store it make it headache. From 2016 until now doesnt have much improvement by BIMB. Really disappointed on failure of management team BIMB.
Worst apps ever... Hard to make a transaction due to lag and endless loading.. i thought banking apps supposed to make my life easier.. but when i need to make a transaction through biz page.. i still need an approval of my transaction through these slow apps.. useless..
I dont even know what happening with this app anymore. i cant even open the apps and used it to pay online. It said server error continuously. Everytime i need to pay online i have to open this app and approve the payment but this app didnt work at all. Let me just use TAC if this app have a problem .this is worst.
Worst apps...always loading...I can't use online transfer just because must validate by this apps... in the end still to use old system go to ATM and transfer via machine
It's always says cannot connect to server. I cannot use this app at all. Please improve your app or i should change my bank soon.
Good and improved on the accessibility. Keep going to serve better.
I got error all the time went to sign in... I need to uninstall and install again.. And it will be the same.. The application take more time then last version...
Can't connect to the server, for days. Good job screwing up the fund to develop the apps, BIMB
App is not working at all. It keeps showing the loading icon. Thanks to not working I am unable to approve transfers when using rhe website instead
Always error, dont create app if always be like this,.. need to open website everytime.. From IOS to Android still facing the same problem. Poor technical system
Apps bugs for many time when i used to pay with qr.. Long queue rear me for paying ahhh lukcily can put atleast 1 star if dont i wont rates even 1 star
Still worse after update on latest version. Lag, didnt show account history, qr pun loading, disarankan bertukar ke bank lain
System very slow during login.. sometime need to re-install the app then can use..
App updated. Unable to access service. Bad app. Response from admin also bad. Bank Islam get this sort out
As i using it,this apps become more stable and smooth than before, keep it up 🤗
New version has better than previous version. Good improvement for Bank Islam. Proceed with tagline 'Assuring Trust. Delivering Value'.
Takes forever to load, very slow, please fix the loading time issue
very baddddd. always cannot open. always server error!
Still bad service...slow maintenance...I can't even do anything through website or application
Apps keep stuck before login page. Your apps and server is made up of a potato or what?
The apps enlighten my routine. Its futuristic and fast.
So inconvenience. Lag almost all the time. Please please please improve this app
I rated 1 star in 2019 (deleted) and i can now attest that Go has made so much improvements. Go, you deserve 5 stars.
Easy to use even for beginner with appropriate button function
The apps is always unable to connect to the server
take so much time just to check my balance, it keeps giving server error😌
Straightforward to use and app has been improving over time!
too bad, always need to update, poor servers .
apps yg sgt tidak membantu,nak log in pon susa,x dpt..buffer..pakai chrome ok je log in..tp x guna gak klau pki chrome nk buat approval kne log in apps gk..benda ni da lama x de improvement pon..please la BIMB learn from others bank apps such as HLB very effsien n convenient..
Very disappointed with the apps, apps keep lagging, hanging. It takes too long even to log in and it just keep crashing. Just do something about it. 1/5 star
Not even worth for 1 star. Please do something about the update. As user, we called contact centre, emailed to mobileadmin.. No useful feedback is given... But for dis time, after update, dont uninstall & reinstall back. U will face cooling off for 12 HOURS. ALL TRANSACTIONS CANNOT DO.. So please, increase your patience or change to other bank...
Unable to connect to server. And still the same even already update the apps :(
Why during Im buying foods you decided to be unavailable its hard yk I need the money seriously can you hurry up I need to use the card seriously I couldn't even pay for the food bc of the maintenance
Very bad poor app for banking..need to upgrade like other banking system..not friendly user..dissapointed
Am having trouble downloading mobile transaction receipt, whereby nothing is downloaded.. its blank if share!!!
I cannot open the app since I downloaded the new version. It kept showing the Unable to Connect to Server box everytime I open the app. I have been using it for 2 years and it got its up and down, but this time is the worst. And since everything needed to be aunthenticate using the Go app, I found it very inconvenient and a huge hassle. Please do something about it. Thank you.
Very lousy apps. I think lot of people already acknowledged the issue so i have nothing more to say
Keep crashing and unable to connect to server
Worst apps i had used, always buffering and can not log in ..who's your IT department pic for server ..should change that person ..
Hire someone can fix this apps asapla. Aiyoo. Big company but loading time never improve.

Too slow to open, missed my transaction. Latest app version.
Seriously..just go back using pin number..using this app to confirm every purchase is nightmare..
Hire some better developers. Super slow app, assuming it's actually loading at all
Not so convenience to use for the waiting time. Need to always update.

Every time to open the apps always be loading until infiniti.. Hurmm
If I can give Half star. I will. Alway keep me waiting too long, Loading and loading.
Apps very slow..please do apps fast..very very very disappointed..
Why when i open this app, an error 500 appears. Please solve this issue as soon as possible
The app getting improvements with user-friendly functions.
I actually wanted to give this app five stars, but after seeing the rating which is 1.3...then I decided to give 1 star...in simple words, I want to set the rating to always be 1...AHAHAHAHAH 🤣🤣 poor "bank islam".
After a new update this week it seems even worst than previous, Cant even open always loading
if u cannot give better service then dont forced us to use ur apps..make many people in trouble..please take note with a lot of comment here n there..n pls do improve it
What kind of app that keep getting slower after update. All they can do is say sorry and after a year waiting for improvement, it keep getting worse with heavy traffic and all. WARNING just delete the app and have better life using other bangking app.
Really bad experience with this apps, always hanging..round and round but not appear. Want to do online, ask to use this apps but always fail..
New apps so sucks.. Make me stress to use it.. Waiting so long and still loading...
Hi there. Just want to highlight an issue where whenever I tried to set up a new favourite account, or adjusting any setting in the apps, out of the blue, there will be a pop up saying "No valid session...". And I will be forced to log out. This occur not only once, but a few time that I got so annoyed and irritated. Kindly take a prompt action to fix this tq
To slow...update for nothing...pls upgrade your system...bodo punya apps....menyusahkan user....slow mau mampus...xpayah update la kalau slow...
Could you separate your ATM locations and branch locations because the branch locator is mixed up with ATM locations. I want to search for a branch.
A good initiative. Had been using it for a while and had decent exp. But I can't put myself to give a better rating when the app keeps on crashing after an update. Never have I ever have to uninstall & reinstall an app per update. & don't get me start with the lag. Even when my data is good, the app failed to load. Please make an effort to repair these bugs. Tiring & malfunctioning as well. On a flip side, it feels safe to use. Won't use anymore unless necessary.
New version is horrible terible, loading is too long and doesn't allow to screenshot. Old version is better. Not statified with the current version.
Took long time to load, please fix for most Android device
Useless app, loading to long. During emergency time need to transfer money suddenly unable to open app. Really hope for improvement. I'm thinking of switching to maybank after this. Good bye Go bank islam.
Bad bad bad .please developed the software with better performance .check the cache .possibility how the data been transfered.take care about time processing and multhreathing.the ui is good but the performance out
Take time for loading. Sometimes it took half an hour. I try to log in using chrome to make online transfer but it still require me to use go secure in the apps. 😮‍💨😮‍💨 Please fix your apps. Thank you
Soooo slow to open the app... the loading took so long... very difficult to check my statement bcs it's always got prob. Very bad app.. always have prob and it took me so long to open app especially when I'm in urgent. Really need to be improve!!!!!
Just so terrible & annoying, this is the worst banking app i ever used, now its latest feature introduced verification through the app when you want to make an online transactions, i can't even login the app..everytime i wanna do a transaction, i need to go to nearest atm..so what's the point of this trash app anyway, so useless..
A really bad app. Cannot login. But i cannot do transaction from internet banking. I need to get the secure code from the app, but the app cannot be opened. Maybank is way much better than this. Its a total failure for me. It should have been 0 star from me.
I download this to experience a much better and faster services, but end up got more lagging, more waiting and in the end cant even function properly... Quite disappointed to be honest.. update:imma change the rating to 5* now since it work well. Thanks for your hardwork~
Slow, very bad.. i need to wait for so long, but most of the time it didnt load at all!! Do something....dont launch an app, if it is not ready .. TAP was much more reliable than GO
In-app purchase authorization (GO-secure) crashed continuously despite good internet connectivity. OTP system usually okay (but lagged in sending the code also at some point) but the latter is way laggy and worse.
I don't know whether the apps is useless or it is useless but its uselees either way. Service not available, glitching, loading.. doing online banking but need to approve transaction on apps and yet the apps crashing.. why there is no improvement made despite bunch of complaints
The worst online banking app in Malaysia, no doubt. For 3 days I cannot make any payment due to high traffic, high volume, error and whatsoever. Just imagine if you only have 1 bank that use online banking. You can't make any transfer, can't pay bill, can't do online purchases. Please upgrade your system. Go find new tender, new company to handle the server. I'm sick of it and I'm on the way to change to another bank.
Totally trash and unreliable apps. It look like the bank hire the intern to develop the apps. Always have issue to start the app especially during online payment. Please improve
Always getting high traffic error when payday. There has been no improvement for the past few months to solve the issue. I cant use the apps on payday.
I can't make any payment. the app keep loading. wasting time. fyi the app is updated. WiFi also excellent. the app is the issue. please bring IAC back.
Worst appplication ever. You are making it compulsory for verification via go by bank islam for each transaction but the apps is not functioning most of the time. This is so annoying and cause lots of problem for the user during transaction.
Very disappointing, please improve your app service, as there's now a mandatory to approve any transaction using the app. If the app keep stuck at the loading screen how on earth we cam complete the transaction
I literally just wanted to buy top up but the website ask me to download this before I can proceed with my purchase, trying to login into the app takes so much time that the timer had already been expired and I can't even get past the Bank Islam logo😠, consider switching to another bank that has a better mobile app experience than this app
Is a very rubbish app. Why already so many people complaining about this app and still don't want solve the problem are you just ignore what the things that people complaining at here? The app keep on cannot log in keep on say error and I want to reload e wallet need to go the app to approve it I cannot make it also want to use online pay also also need the app to approve. What for make people difficult if this keep on happening and we cannot make our things done and no any improvement.
Bank Islam can you improve your app it really slow like turtle then i can't even login to my acc because of it keeps loading, do better and find someone that can fix your app. I have been using this app for 2 years and the problem still the same please fix to make it more better
lagging and slow. if we have to use this apps to make an approval of transaction please keep this apps always in good maintenance and friendly useable. been hours waiting and lagging just to make an approval transaction. or please provide for users to choose either approve using TAC or this ridiculous apps. i just want the best for BANK ISLAM
It is veryyyy slow. Oftentime when i wanna authorize any transaction using go by bank islam, i have to do it 4-5 times because it keeps loading. There are times i couldnt proceed with the authorization at all. Please bank islam. Upgrade your app.
I don't know what's wrong with this app,every time I try to login,it don't allow me to do so..I already put the right password,but still it didn't work out..and always lag,hope so it soon will be fix..
Always problem with the internet connection. No matter how many update. Used to be fine with the website. But now can't do any transaction in it anymore without using the app.
After updated more loading! Use website also need to approve on apps! It has been 2 years this apps got problem and still can't solve it! All are SINECURE! It's so annoying! Worseeeee apps ever! Waste time and slowww!
Difficult to use. Internet banking more convenient before. But still need to approved by GO app and delayed internet banking transaction. Not all people have big phone storage just for all kind of apps.
Whenever I'm opening the app the only thing it says unable to connect to the server. Even though I update the app same problem every time. So irritated.
I have to wait so long before i can make transaction. Please improve. Sometimes, i can't even open this apps if i have some emergency transaction. Please improve this apps. Don't make it worse!. Please.
The worst app you can possibly imagine. Please provide a service that you can deliver, if not just cancel it out. Take a verrryyyyyyyy long time to log in, to scan qr. It just DON'T WORK OUT. Please don't say we sorry to hear your problem etc etc. Just get it fixxxxxxed okay. TQ
This app is a way for the bank itself to scam its patrons. With how the bank forces patrons to use this non-functioning app to make any transfers. Its best to just close the account and go to another bank.
I need to approve transaction on the app but it keep getting error 500. Being trying for few days already in hoping it back to normal. Now I'm late to pay for things because of this app. QR also so slow. Hope the team can have a full testing on the app before release to public. Thank you
stupid app. on hari gaji day cannot log in due to high volume traffic. it said for alternative to use the website. but when do the transaction with the website they need the secure code that is sent to the app. so cannot do also. stupid
Don't know how to say,but I'm really disappointed, because of this app, i rather like the old version cause it can access fast and quick, rather than this version, i know the future in this app are improving,but please improve the system also, worst
worst banking apps ever! Keep loading ended up with server error and taking like ages just to do simple onlind transfer. The apps really testing my patience!! Latest update June23: I thought Bank Islam GO improved! But worsen. Keep telling us to clear cache, but nothing good is happening! Please remove requirement to use GO if your apps capability and quality is not yet UP to minimum standard expected! Feeling frustrated as LOYAL client of Bank Islam for yearsssss!
the app becoming more worse than ever.. every transaction more than Rm100 need to approve from this very baaaaaaaaaaaaaadd app, and yet user can't even login.. its keep buffering FOREVER! fix this already.. its been months i've tolerated, clearing cache everytime i need to login.. you've done NOTHING to improve
so bad. took too long to login even when not on payday. maybank2u is much better. how logically could u think that it keep saying high traffic whenever i tried to login while my friends could easily login. i am sure that this is not about phone issue
I dont understand why the apps is slow. I'd rather doing the online banking using google chrome. It is faster compared to the apps itself. I hope Bank Islam will address this issue as soon as possible
No offense, I know it is the goverment orders to use secure2u in mobile apps for verification relating to any online payments but you gotta fix the unstable problems of your mobile apps as soon as possible, guys. It's hindering day to day operations.
It always have an issues such as hard to log in, take very long time when loading and unable to connect with server. I'm sick of this kind of problems. Please fix it.
I tend not to give any star for the apps..... Always stuck at startup and cannot login this apps.... More than a month this issue still status quo.. Not sure what are the action taken by Bank Islam team.....if there is a chance, for sure will transfer all to another bank acc....
Dear team..why i cannot open the app?it keep saying "unable to connect server".i already install and uninstall many time..this is the third day i keep install and uninstall...i notice when have event on that month bank islam apps will be crash every day..please improve your trafic to avoid this kind of situation..this is second time i comment at here..but still no improvement.
I need to make a important transfer right now and the app is not working like it took too much time for loading and it sign out it own. Really really bad experience and so disappointed with this app right now.
App is laggy and full of error. I have uninstalled and reinstalled. But still cannot open the app. It stated that error 500. Please do something! I cannot transfer my money online because the approval need to be done on apps
Always experiencing failed transactions when I start to use this Go App system. I really don't like it. Not convenient to use it. It's better for not using this system. I think I should use other bank.
Frustrating, tried to make a transaction by web because the apps won't stop load and stuck on the welcome page, but then after inputing all the info required still need to approve the web transaction by apps which i can't open hmmmm
Worst apps ever. They keep loading all the time. However, I can smoothly use the other bank apps, so it's not an issue with my internet connection. I had no problems when using Chrome for bank Islam Internet banking
The most irritating online banking app. Now need to approve in bank Islam Go for online transaction, while I cannot even access to the app. Gosh need to do something about it. Always unavailable. So not helpful at all.
How did you managed to mess it up? it was doing fine before. right now its just impossible to even log into the app. loads forever and suddenly system is currently unavailable.
The worst ever apps compared to other competitor banks. Unable to open, keep loading and loading... Once u able to login, keep delayed in receiving the TAC... So many issues...bad customer experience...
Really great to whomever force this app of any transaction. Who's idea would great enough to forcely link any transaction with an app so buggy. Bring back message code! This app is not suitable for older phone!!!
As a customer, I am gonna be very honest. Did you see all the bad reviews here? Everyone of them filed the same complain and it seems you did not take any action for the matter. If that does not ring a bell, let me tell you the problem, your apps are extremely lagging, it frequently jammed which cause my transaction cancelled, I am embarassed when the cashier waiting for me to pay for 30 MINUTES, 30 MINUTES, I'm not even exaggerate, this happens too often. You must fix the problems immidiately.
Very poor apps, even no issue with Internet speed, the apps still lag for a few minutes. Most stressful bcoz need to approve transactions via go secure but apps hang to open
First time login, masuk kan sms FA, error 500 Edit: switch lines & retry. Work like a charm. Edit2: everytime there's new update I have to key in password and set fingerprint setting again, this is stupid and wasting time. Please fired your app vendor!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What can i say. I am a truly frustrated, disappointed user. This apps is way below the normal standard of other online banking apps such as m2u, cimbclicks etc. I would even give 0 star if google allows me to! Update 24/6/2023: This apps is still suxx. No improvement at all. Even worse than before. I would still go for 0 star!
Bad experience. Slow apps just to load the login page. For certain payment, need approval from apps, but this apps stuck. Please invest to improve and overcome the bottleneck especially on the salary day.
Having a nightmare with this app, keeps on circling until the requested times are up. Not once, can't recalled the experience. Truly disaster
This app really make my business even worse. Take a really long time to loading which I need to delay my important transaction just to wait it loading. The server always error. Really hard to go with this app.
This apps was performing from normal to bad . Now going from bad to worse. Please do something. Upgrade it, make it faster and don't forget about improving it's safety features.
The worst online banking app in the history ever made! What kind of degen software developers that you hired huh? I can't even open the app after the update. Takes 9999 years to load! If you can't be sure that this app can performs flawlessly then don't publish at all! Just stick to the website one man! You're losing a lot of customers here trust me! And I'm wasting googolplex of my timea Not recommended at all!
Dear bank islam....just delete this app from Google play. This app exist just to ruin my day and my storage...if it's won't able to function well then there is no reason for it to exist. It's been a decade and this problem seem to be remain unsolved like forever. Thanks for providing stupidest online banking app ever 👍. Just don't wanna harsh but if soft spoken won't so why don't?
Please hire someone that really good in IT. So, your user can using this app easily and more faster like a cheetah. Your apps now is almost being near with useless. PLEASE FIX IT!! FIX IT!! FIX IT!!
I need to APPROVE my transaction with this app, but this app can't even open!! You do realise that people have to do transaction on the web BECAUSE the app DOESN'T WORKK!! Now you want us to use your useless app to approve that transaction?! Who's stupid idea was this??!! Worst banking app I've ever experienced!! Just abolish the app and focus on the web!! The app is an epic FAILURE!!!!!
They always pending my transaction.. my money also successful transfer but when i check in another account, my money still stuck. it happened 2x to me and now i stuck again my transaction! Please improve your system !
I'm out of words. Really. Setiap update membuat app bertambah teruk. I am not even sure whether our complaints are taken into account, it looks like we are replied by the bot. Tak tahu apa solusi tech team Bank Islam untuk masalah berpanjangan mengenai app, bertahun-tahun ini. Menyusahkan keadaan. Transactions perlu approved melalui app, and yet the app itself failed to load at THE VERY BEGINNING OF LAUNCH. Transaksi kami ni jenaka ke, bagi Bank Islam?
This is worst app experienced that I ever had... The loading screen took way too long and sometimes you cant even open the app for the whole day. This have caused me lot of problem
The app is slow even though my internet connection is good because the other apps are okay. I can open them fast but not this app. Thank you Update: Assalamualaikum bank islam. Saya rasa pihak bank islam dah sedia maklum tentang apps online banking yang sangat slow. Ramai cakap benda sama. Saya rasa boleh slowly take action instead of suruh buat aduan kat email etc.
12/07 - I had to install and uninstall it a few times. Not just normal update. Super stress!!! Hari ni nak login tak boleh keluar error 500 APZ_TSN_500. Apa ni Bank Islam, ulang tahun ke 40, servis makin teruk. 14/07 - 2 times transaction failed because of loading time took more than 3 minutes. Bank Islam tolonglah upgrade server.
Buggy, loading... if happen surely need re-install back. Edited: Now the response getting ok. Just my favourite from website not available in apps, need to re-add. Overall ok easy, good & smooth. #keepitup
Previous version more compatible compared for right know. Keep loading and crash. Please⁹x,make iit be an enjoyable apps ro use. Not getting more stress from it
Always problematic to open. Now for the past few days, i continuously getting error to open the app. Trying to uninstall and reinstall. Same problem. Truly useless app.
The apps is super duper lagginggggg!! Sometime after the long wait can login to the system but sometime will just show error message! Clear cache multiple times also not working 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I need to use the apps to do online transactio but can't even open the apps. Loading je memanjang..tekan ape2 keluar blank page..stop depend on the apps if the apps is always crash.
Slow, then suddenly my account have a limit for transferring to other accounts even though it is less than the daily limit set beforehand. Try asking help from support but its useless.
the latest version for bank islam is so disappointed. it make hard to the late version of phone to be install that application especially for the older one . is it the best that you can do for the people who was using ur application ? if this keep happening, it's only make people to choose another bank 😤
Very slow. Please improve your app. After all these years of update, transaction become worsed as you still need to open the apps even using web biz page. Very unprofessional of handling customer complaints. Shameful
Previous version much better than new update. To Developer this app supposed to help user & enhanced ur security not give burden on them. Manager, Sales, Pre-Sales, Marketing & Developer please improved your application before we change to used other services. Thank you.
Before this the app is just okay, but yesterday an error message keeps popping up and wouldn't disappear and I cannot make any transactions using Bank Islam. I have Deleted the app yesterday.
Worst mobile banking app ever, slow and sometimes just does not work. If in an emergency the person would have died waiting for the app to start.
ALWAYS UNABLE TO CONNECT TO THE SERVER / NO FUNCTION Cannot approve the transaction since cannot login into the Go by Bank Islam apps. VERY STUPID apps. NOTORIOUS for crashing. Like always the pegawai bank will only say sorry for inconvenience. The fact is, on customer's part, it is not inconvenience but a difficult hindrance to the transaction. TAKE NOTE BANK ISLAM. DON'T BE BITTER WITH THIS COMMENT BUT GET BETTER!!
I guess it is either the dev team is underpaid or you lots just plain idiot with no brain. Wasted half an hour just to make an instant transfer to another account. I don't wish you guys the dev team success. The Dev team doesn't deserve to be happy or successful in this world due to their "phenomenal" banking app. No improvements since the last 3-4 years. Lazy developers!
This app so problematic, try to login since yesterday and still its loading though I have good internet. I couldn't make any payments. Even CIMB I can login with 512 kbs when I'm run out of data.
too bad when opening his apps, always loading. why is this happening? his service is too bad. It's really hard for me to transfer money to other people because it's hard to open their apps, just load them Please take immediate action.tq
As a student using bank islam is really difficult.Because most off the time this app is not working properly.if we want to top up or transfer the money it's really hard for us. Most of the time this app is not working properly....
Very unfriendly user. Takes a very long time to load. Unexpected time to make a maintenance and everything bad combine in one app
recently using this app is difficult and unpleasant, since it takes too long to open and also frequently not responding. very frustrating since i cant settle my bills and payment as planned.
Suddenly show a server network error and even after reinstall the app, its good for a few hours then the same thing happen again. Fix this thing
The worst ever. Install uninstall for three times. Still cannot open the apps. Better dont have the apps if its can't be open or lagging all the time.
So far the slowest mobile Internet banking app i ever used..still can't open the apps after 10 minutes waiting.. Affect my payment / transfer every month.. Bank islam should have assess again this apps.. Using website is better, but still need secure number from apps..
I'm sorry but please please please hire someone who can really do the jobs right. Why this app always laggy and buggy.. why it keeps reloading... how many times do I have to keep key in the information.. so not user friendly
Worst app ever. Might consider to change to other banks if you don't improve / upgrade your apps. Update on 25/6/23: still cannot use. Don't bother to download this app. USELESS
I was using bank Islam website to transfer but couldnt and the website told me to download the apps. Now i cant even login the apps because there is error popup. The worst apps, service and a waste of time.
Please improved the apps for better experience..regret to use it as my main bank transaction...anything related on online payment so lembap bapak lahh..link with go transactions not sync, pending and transaction will be invalid..did not sure amount transaction were deducted or not..to open apps / using qr paid kena sidai macam hape.bende laa bank apps mcam ni.letihlaa...
I couldn't even open up the apps, such a bummer! I need to do instant transfer, but the apps didn't help at all. Do better with the apps Bank Islam..
I don't know what happened but it seems I can't log in into my account, is it under maintenance? Because it always log out when I'm login. Hard for me to make transaction
Please improve your system. Seriously so stress when people using to play. 1st thing is the GO app. No need actually when we using OTP. Then always system is currently not available. My God seriously so stressed. improve improve improve please🙏🏽
Worst application ever. The application should be more easier but became more harder. Cannot use the application at all. I even cannot pay my bill.
The slowest apps that universe can handle. I think, it is faster to go to the bank, take a number and que at the counter just to know my account balance than waiting this app to load.
The previous one i think much better. The new version i cant even log in, it just keep on loading and loading 🙂 please fix the issue.
Can't open the app for so long. How to transfer my money?? Even when i'm trying to topup my shopee pay, I cant use this bank because I need to open the app to authorize the transaction. Please improve asap 😠
(Edited) Now, the app navigation seems ok for me. So i add 2 star more from my original 1 star review before. Also, for not be able to see my transactions history pains me. So no more star for you for now
VERY VERY BAD!!!! WHY THE SYSTEM IS VERY SLOW UNLIKE MAYBANK. Bfr this, I can buy the ticket without need to download the go bank Islam apps. But today suddenly I must use the app to settle the payment. This app is very bad & please do not trouble us as the bank Islam users with your bad system.
Trash apps, sorry for the harsh word but come on Bank Islam? Already 2021 but still with this kind of apps. Hardly stable to use. People use mobile apps for convenience not to get more headache haiya. Update : 2023 still trash. Both website and mobile apps cannot be used at all. Don't bother using Bank Islam anymore
Update your system properly. What's the use of keep updating but the outcome got worse. Ugh if it's not for my uni i would never use this trashy app. BANK ISLAM PLEASE IMPROVE YOUR SYSTEM. THE PROBLEM HAS ONGOING FOR SO LONG BUT THERE'S NO ACTION TAKEN? WORST BANKING APP EVER
i want to review without giving A star actually. This app always bug . if i uninstall and install back, i have to wait another 12 hours so i can use the transfer method and others . what a problematic app . VERY TROUBLESOME .
Always high volume of traffic. Not ideal for emergency. Loading time takes too long. Need more than 10 minutes just to load up QR.
This app is really terrible. It's always have problems and when you enter the app, it's take too much time to load. Mybank app is better in my opinion.
I can't even open the apps after the update! Worst banking apps ever. It make the transactions more difficult/ almost impossible!!!
I want to online transfer, but due to apps server error, i need to wait until it's okay. No option like TAC or other if something happen like this. Poor apps.
Slowest apps to be honest..Please take your users opinion for better result..We suffer more than anyone everytime we try to make transition,transfer and everything..Please make sure your apps run more smoothly..TQ
Super slow after updates, login, transaction ,then after finish transfer ,it log out ,then try to login again, access denied. Done reinstall. Still problem occur .please check .
Downloaded it for the first time today and all I get is "Server Error: Unable to connect to the server". What a waste of time. Not going to bother trying it later in the future if it can't even function.
Trying to open the apps but got an issues on the server, tried to uninstall it but until today its failed, please resolve this issues ASAP (15/12/22). UNTIL TODAY THIS IS ISSUES IS NOT RESOLVE (02/08/23)
Please bank Islam improve your application. It takes time to open and sometimes there have many errors.. It's easy to use but the loading and errors make me annoyed.
Recevied error message "Reach maximun of user id". After de-listed user and add new user. Please fix this issue. I believe this is only minor issue.
I wanted to do the transaction request from other app, then it asked me to redirect to this app to continue the transaction. But when i opened this app, it suddenly said "please reinitiate the transaction" and the app stuck with that popup window.
Too Slow and unstable. Its year 2023. Even a 'Car Wash' business has an apps now. Your internal budget for online banking apps and marketing must have been gone to somewhere else,i predict. Lastly, 'Riba' is haram😁
Really disappointing with the BANK ISLAM application, it should be easier for every customer when they want to make an online transaction, there must be a problem, please fix it don't waste the customer's time many times have faced this problem very disappointing.
Just updated today and your app just gave me an "Error 500" What does that mean and I've tried uninstall and reinstall a couple of times but it still gives me that error code 500.. please help!
cant login. the same id and password were use in desktop,but keep on sying "invlid credential" in apps. i cant transfer money as the desktop online bankin ask to install this app to setup something at its setting. now useless.
Bad service ever, i wanted to login but keep denying even though already put the right password, then i have to wait within 12 hours before i can proceed for any payment after change the password, please make sure to update this thing
Worst bank app. Most of the time cannot login, high traffic error, lag & slow. I will rate 0 star if given the option.
The bank fund did not reflect the amount I have in my account. When open via website, it shows the amount. But in the app only show zero ringgit.
Slow when open the app and even slower when opened using mobile data. Please fix it ASAP, a lot of people using duitnow and online banking for everyday transaction.
Apps always problem and slow response. Its not convenient if you are in a hurry. This is the worse banking app period.!
Take a long time to just load the screen. For what forcing us to stop using the website and use the apps . Seriously ? Not convenience
Hello Bank Islam, what kind of improve if your apps always stuck and loading? Really troubling the user. The most trouble apps bank that i used, sorry not gonna used this apps anymore, you guys never take this as lesson. Bye forever and ever !!
the application is really bad .. it's been two days since I've been trying to enter or login , I can't .. oh my god . It's hard to make a transaction..
Forced to install to enable online transfer. Installed, went through all the stupid steps, logged me off multiple times. 2 hours in I still can't do anything. Modern day robbery.
Apps is SOOOO problematic. HAVE TO REACTIVATE QR CODE FOR EVERY.SINGLE.USE??!! LOAD TIME?FOREVER EVEN WITH WIFI😑 you update the apps but nothing happens 😩
Very slow apps, difficult to do online transaction (always received error), cannot use screenshot for proof of payment use, always received error so many times, very bad apps...
Please acknowledge all the reviews you received. This apps received 1 star for most of the ratings and bad feedbacks but still no improvement from the admin. Please do something and improve your apps. This apps just make things harder. Even 1 star is over rating.
The worst app i have been used. Update , update, update but nothing improve. Each transaction (above limit) need to approve by app, but cannot open to approve. So HOW? Really annoyed. Does not deserve even for 1 star. Shd be 0.
Not even worth of one star. Slow, sluggish. Login using fingerprint will fail most of the time.
Bro..seriously, i am in urgent to do the transaction and the apps keep on crashing. Open by browser, and need to confirm transaction by using this apps. Seriously?
Very bad system. Doing the transaction online always on lag i can die because of this system makes my food transaction always failed. Shame on you.
The current version is take time to open compared to old version. It's really annoyed. Please upgrade the system.
Cannot even start the app, now online banking through regular web cannot perform online transaction, what other option the user has for online transaction then? Please fix the app. Thank you
Disappointed!! The worse apps in my phone. Eventhough Im using browser, i still need to authorised my transaction through this apps. The problem is i can't even open it. Shame on you bank islam.
Bank islam service didn't improve their log in apps delay even few years. Very bad
Loading takes forever using Redmi note 11s but run smoothly on redmi note 11 pro 5g.
Why got problem when to open ? The app want loading until when ?? Until I have child or i die ? I can't to make payment ! It's so very double triple bad !! Very and very triple disappointed !!!
I do not know why the app so lagging. This really affect my transactions for biz. Have to restart over and over end up using on the web to transfer.
Too many error. From log in up to transferring fund. Please fix the apps, or just remove it from apps store if u are not going to fix it
Bila nak upgrade apps ni? Basic function pun tak tercapai. Duk loading memanjang. Malu la sikit dengan apps Maybank. Contohi apps mereka. . Update: developer noob. Cannot provide even the basic function of the apps
This stupid thing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!@@×!×@!×+I can't load to the app. It's says cannot connect to server. Have been trying many times, still failed 😔
I found that the latest fixes/releases makes this apps better and user friendly
The apps keep on loading until time to do transactions out. Worst banking apps ever.. I had to go to the bank to do it manually..
Please upgrade your apps, hard to access. Sometimes need to wait loading for long time before and after login. Functionality too slow..2 star at the moment until its run smoothly
Very bad experience with this app, please upgrade your system. Poor, incompetent, waste of time, awful at the every corner...
Pls fix ur server or whtever issue it is. I hve experiencing ths issue since ths early 2023 n i have limited patience. I hve been considering changing my bank acc bcos of ths apps
not even worth 1 star. just like other reviewer, the app is now worse after the update. Loading takes forever, online transaction took so long despite having fast internet. Lagi update lagi teruk hmmm
Not deserve a star at all. BIMB need to do drastically changes to make sure this app functionally correctly. Else, it will leads to customer loss to other conventional bank services.
App doesnt do anything (almost all time i used it)! DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING IF IT IS NOT BROKEN!
It takes too long to loading.. And the apps crashed frequently.. it makes it hard to get approval for duitnow system..
Horrible.What is wrong with your apps? Now it is very slow to access my account.It keep on logging, until I give up.. You must keep up with other banks' app!
Previous version much better. Current version always lagging & it is troublesome when i want to use it urgently. Hopefully BIMB can do something.
Always error opening the app. Showing high traffic everytime !!! How to confir. TAC if app always crash ?? Shame lah u manage this app. 😡😡
Lembap gile app ni...nak open app took very long period that I can made coffee baru bole bukak... sometimes the app cannot open cause having inconvenient problem... developer please improve this damn app and fix the problem...other bank apps work smoothly but this app work very dull
Bagus. The banking app has been improved a lot! Thanks!
The apps cannot open or even to register. Also, you need to open the apps for approval transaction even you are doing money transfer through website.stupid application.
if theres a zero star review i would give it to this app...Like seriously?...Why do you need to make a payment everytime we need to go through the app? its stupid and slow
Too bad the apps so bad la. 2 days waiting to make transaction still cannot do. Using website also crashed. Please make an improvement asap.
Very slow. Rubbish app. Sorry to say.
After update cannot open the apps until today.Pervious apps more better.
Update review: JUST PERISH! My balance was deducted when I am sure I never made any transaction recently. This is after updating the app as of 2 oct 2023. App keep showing no transaction history at all! The worst banking app ever. Slow loading, not to mention you have to log in to this trashy banking app whenever you need to verify online transactions through go secure, but sometimes it doesn't even show up. Update and UPGRADE your feature and loading rate or just terminate this app entirely.
Another update and yet this app still disapponts. This time, merely logging in to the app itself is time consuming and stress-inducing; let alone performing online banking transactions via the app, God knows how long it will take. My previous review prevails with add-ons to the already long complaint. Rather appalling given the slow page loading and difficulty of connecting to the app. It was quite frustrating and inconvenient when the app was supposed to have 'streamlined' online banking.
Apps always lagging, some times not responsed, please solve the problem a.s.a.p
Very very bad services. Apps cannot be open and seldomly successful to make transaction. Hoping there will be improvement in near future
The apps keep loading and unable to login.
The worst bank app ever! Its always loading and takes too much time for me to use qr pay. I end up using other bank app which is more fast and efficient
Worst experience ever. Loading takes forever. Simple assignment cannot be done. Plan your schedule weeks ahead or just accept that nothing can be done through this app
Using this apps for quite long and already updated the latest version,but i'm still don't see the improvement using this apps. Worst and too slow.
It's very, way too annoying! Don't bother making an app if you don't intend for it to work! It's been a year or more since I have this app and it keeps crashing all the time. Can count with my finger how many times it work during a year! Please fix this or just delete this app from the playstore, u r making its hard since want to pay shoppee also got through this piece of app!
Can't even open smh.. Alr update, now can open but cannot log in..
Worst working apps. That's I can conclude about this apps..unable to connect to server, traffic bla bla bla. So frustrated.
Apps cant login. Wth is this!? Why do we need to get the securego from the apps when the apps can't even open?! Please fix! I have tons of bills to pay wih due dates!!!
Whoever in charge with developing this app should resign, not competent at all, most of the time not working
I have tried many times to login still cannot login and the password is wrong eventhough i have entered the password correctly. Still having the same problem
This app has been the lousiest since from the beginning. I hope the team will rectify the issue. Everytime error!
the most retarded app on planet, how could this app still exists at this moment. even a snail would be faster than this app, and whose idea was it to confirm the online purchase through this stupid app and thought it would be a great idea when it is slow as hell ?
Its sincerely getting worse!! Its keep loading without getting anywhere. Please fix this asap.. Ppl use it everyday.. If we just open it for it to be loading, then what the point???
Poor app. Not go for user friendly. Not easy to access. Unable to connect the server 😞😞😞
Not happy with the apps efficiency. Loading, loading, loading until the time ended. Please improve your efficiency. So upset
Please fire all of your swqa and dev team and management , lots of bugs in this app slow loading time, lots of items in app dissappearing reappearing randomly
Bank Islam Go is testing my patience. Banyak kena istighfar, banyak kena ingat kepada Allah because when you need to open the app, you can't because of high volume or because they're experiencing technical issues. Fix the app, Bank Islam, once and for good.
As of now (6/11/23 11.51pm) the app stays on loading page. Tried with different type of internet connection but it's still loading. Didn't have any issues through bimb webpage. Only the app. Already tried to restart the phone and open the app again though. P. S: after reading all the recent reviews, makes me wonder, does the latest version of the app is still very bad?
Fixed the rooted device issue on my last review. It gets the job done, but not in optimal way. I'd rather browsing through website compared to this. Loading each page was slow, even website version load faster. Whenever I wanted to do transfer be it IBG or Instant Transfer, I have to reinput my password again. I cannot use fingerprint authentication, as it was only for first app login. Another hassle for me.
Trash app. Can't even load the login page
I cannot open the app after so many tries. This makes it harder to do a transfer. Please resolve the problem faster. Thank you.
Transaction error error error error error non stop. Seriously noob, super useless especially TAC, making functional apps and services super trash. Just fired whoever team that development this apps.
The worst worst worst worst bank apps ever!!!!!! Take forever to load even though the wifi signal is good.. The web server is better than this stupid apps!!! But the web server is not that good also!!!!
I hardly login to this apps nowadays..It keeps loading,showing the circling icon everytime when ever I try to open it. Delete and reinstall many times,but the problem still the same..If this keep happens, I wont be able to use my Bimb online services since it is required to be approved from this apps, and it is so troublesome.
The worst banking app in Malaysia I've used. Everything loads up very poorly. You want to pay some stuff at the store using qr? Well, you'd die of old age first. Even the Bank Islam website sucks. People that uses this intentionally are masochists.
Supposed to be, an app make things easier. But this apps make things harder. Everytime I downloaded it, I need to key in the data like I'm a totally new user. Although I re-install it on the same device. Worst experience is today. When it magically TOTALLY log out. And when I try to login, it told me to key in data like I'm a new user. Need to re-setup qr pay. Need to key in IC number. The same app that has been running quite a few times before this on the same device. Deserve 0 star I think.
After the new update version, I cant log in as the notifications keep on saying "unable to connect to the server" which is very hassle and time consuming to deal with. Very disappointed with the buggy apps and it doesnt seem helpful at all. Not sure if this happens to android users only or not.
Very very very poor online bank service. Have to try sooo many times before your transaction success using this apps. Please improve your poor service guys.
Apps got lots of prob during startup. Reinstall and its gna deauthorize ir registered phone when all u want is to use back. Trash quality.
Bad interface and the worst of all, the line and the online services of the app is barely bearable at most. 0 star.
The apps took time for every process even log in also take too long . Very dissapointed . Sometime its very hard to make money transfer 👎
What happen to this app, it took more time to open it, sometime it waste my time to wait just to transfer the money but in the end i could't.
Fix the bugs and improve the server.
Been using the apps but lately the apps become suck. Super snail and giving a fuss to the customers. Please do something fast or ur going to loose a lot of customers
Apps selalu error. So bila nak transfer, guna biz online, tapi tetap perlu approval dari apps ni yg langsung tak boleh buka. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bank islam should remain with web saja. No need app. Youre not ready to use app bila selalu error. Menyusahkan user.
Very disappointed with the apps. Take very long time to login and even cant doo fpx transaction. This app should make life easier with cashless payment nowadays.
The Go app sooo slow n not responsive in good time. Its take too long for app to activate..its not help for urgent matter when to used it.
I can't open up the apps .. how i'm gonna make transaction? 😭 i already update to the latest One
When we r already at the cashier and the apps dont even work. There and then we tried to uninstal n reinstal.. but sometimes it wont work also after reinstall 🥲
Slow , Cannot do any transfactions. Then its better after the comments
unresponsive. very slow. give you good hard headache .
Till still dont have any updated. I cant even open my app. Why your system is too bad? Please solve this problem! Why have update when is causing more trouble to user!
It is definitely the slowest bank application in Malaysia. I have Maybank, Standard Chartered, Public Bank, UOB, Alliance, OCBC application in my phone. Bank Islam easily the winner in this category. Keep up the good work although I highly doubt that any other bank will be able to defeat you in term of buggy and laggy.
Worst bank app. Slow and always not responsive. Please, I BEG of you, please, make development for this app. Make it function as good as other bank apps.
Please upgrade your online banking system.There is always a problem when users want to log in and always use the excuse that your internet line is problematic but in fact it is not.Please take action as soon as possible because many users want to use it to pay all commitments.Thank you
cannot open the app after the update. Should fix this as it keep on loading for a long time.It still cannot open up to 3 days until now.
So slow to open this app, hopefully this problem will be solve in tge future.
Frequently lags. Loading to log in page very slow. Overall not very secure.
App Server always shows a slow as a snail app's navigation. Kindly check the server in case of hacker intrusion.
Very bad apps. The loading time is so long & it's really not convenient to use it compared to website. If you want to develop an apps make sure it is user friendly and very dissatisfied with this apps. Every transaction is very difficult and make your worry whether it is already successful to be transfer or not. Please make a change. Thank you.
I cannot open the app since I downloaded the new version. It kept showing the Unable to Connect to Server box everytime I open the app. I have been using it for 2 years and it got its up and down, but this time is the worst. And since everything needed to be aunthenticate using the Go app, found it very inconvenient and a huge hassle. Please do something about it. Thank you.
This app is extremely terrible, shame on the developers for not fixing it. Might as well use other alternatives than this slowpoke.
The login part kinda slow while waiting for loading. Sometimes, it freezes and crashed.
Always need updated. Every transaction need approval by secure site (this case, by Bank Islam Go)..but pending and buffer too much. Not user friendly...
Slow, lag and not user friendly
Very bad IB apps. Always shows error even though it has been updated to the latest. Please do something for the customers or else Bank Islam IB will always receive bad reviews.
Slow and laggy..almost every time cant sign in..need to relaunch the app several times.. tonight issue "cant connect to server".
After I put id, password, ic, I waited for a long time to get IAC number but it didn't send it to my mobile number! It's so annoying app!
"unable to connect to server" this problem has occurred few months now. very troublesome. edit : after reinstall this app, I finally can use it as before. BUT, the loading screen before entering the password took FOREVER 😢 if any of you having the same issue, and you are reading this, please clear the app's cache. it makes the app smoother
Loading slow, cant do transaction without it. So much for security when u cant even do a simple transaction
Love this apps. Easy and convenience to access. Go Bank Islam dah BETTER. Alhamdulillah.
PLEASE HIRE BETTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPER. CUSTOMER CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE. SLOW SLOW SLOW, MAINTENANCE ALL THE WAY. SOMETIMES FUNCTION CAN'T BE USED. REBOOT THIS APP PLEASE.
The apps is getting worse day by day. Been waiting for more than 10 mins just to get in...and sometimes didn't even get to log in.
This app is getting worsen day by day, super slow and laggy and not advanced like other banks apps. Please improve your apps service.
Your rating now 1.3..only 1 star..probably ending with no star if playstore allow us... each time update your apps keep freezing... stuck at loading page..do something.. look at your competitor..maybank..cimb...all good
Previous version is better..i cannot see my balance in TH after the update
Bad experience.. alway lag and have lots of problem especially on QR Code and scanning.. why even develop this app if you have no intention to maintain it?
to slow connection..fail..upset...more complicated
This app is really slow, maybe because of the server. Really need to upgrade the responds time for the sistem.
It's fine when it works, but right now it doesn't work more often than it does. Which is a problem since BIMB is now forcing their clients to use this app for transaction approvals. When you want to do that, then the app needs to be reliable, which this app is obviously not. It's taken me several tries and I still can't transfer my money.
Please la... So slow when open the apps, for 30+ min only "pusing-pusing". And please consider to bring back TAC since you apps can't even open to authorize my purchase
The GO secure function is really frustrating. Always didn't work in crucial time. Please do something with your apps.
New update problem. This app stuck at asking me to accept / reject payment. But I did not do any payment. Please repair the problem.
Worst app ever, unable to log in around pay day week 25th until end of month for every month. Really difficult to make any online transaction during this period.
Cannot scan qr from gallery..i already have latest version on my one plus 11
Worst ever, cannot check available balance at all. Any banking payment also lag and too slow. What happen????
da update.. tapi apa yg lambat sgt nk bukaknya..yg lama lagi better than new veraion.. take so long to. open.. disappointed betul dgn isu apps bank islam ni
This app keep loading everytime we try to use it. It really annoying since every online transaction need to be verified by this app.
Loading too long, access denied, then say i had logged in, cant even open in web, clear data and force stop then working, this apps clearly is broken.
Update in April 2023 It's becoming worse. I can't even open the app even after reinstalling it after clear history, cache and reset phone. Recent update is causing problems to open the app. I am unable to use it completely. It take ages to open as well as use the GO verification. I uninstalled, clear cache multiple times with wifi and data connection without any success. I am sure the problem comes from the app itself.
This is most worst bank app in Malaysia. I wonder why Uitm compulsory for student to use Bank Islam as main student bank account?. App very slow, always show loading bubble, I'm unable to log in to app. Bank Islam you are multimillion company, you are supposedly able to upgrade and fix app without problem. New update: I'm done!!!. Time to close Bank Islam account or let's account became dormant. I'm suggest user closed account and change to Maybank MAE and Cimb Octo or transfer to TNG E-wallet.
Bank islam banking app is the slowest and the worst . Server always doesnt work. Imagine trying to pay using the app and u just stare at the loading white page for 30 minutes
I hv tried mny times to pay my bills last few days but never can log in go apps. U shud provide alternative. So disappointing.
Unable to do fund transfer. Keep getting error code. The basic function of transferring money is not properly develop.
Why i cannot check my Tabung Haji account? The apps already update latest version 10. Please assist
I've updated this app and I've lost RM13 once I logged in. Have been checked the transaction history and didn't know where it goes. I still remember the balance in my account. Plus, I just went to ATM a week ago. The amount is still fresh in my head. Got the receipt too. I'm truly disappointed and can no longer trust it. What if losing large amount of money after this? It's scary. I guess I should uninstall this app :( it's no longer secure for me
Why always loading, take to long loading, sign out suddenly, need to uninstall and install back and came out with box that stated i need to performed transaction to TH, DUIT NOW AND OTHERS AFTER 12 HOURS.
I keep on getting 'unable to connect to server' issues and sometimes had to reinstall the apps due to crash and all. Is there any explanation to this? Issues like this have made it so difficult for me to make a transaction especially on important one. So, I'm truly disappointed. I hope you all can fix this. It hindred people's business and matter. Also, why does the app won't allow screenshot? Sometimes, I forgot to share my receipt and try to find back my transaction record but can't screenshot
Please fix... keep getting error exceeded daily limit when making transaction. Need to switch using browser instead, such a hassle...
The apps keeps crashing even i uninstall it. My id also cannot be detected. Why it keeps on loading????
Very disturbing.. every transactions becomes hard due to error of system. It takes time and not efficient at àll. Please update ur service at it is very slow and not working. The service is still not working despite having reinstalled a few times. Saying that I haven't registered though just send me verification of successful register.!!???
Worst banking apps. Keep loading although internet line is good. Unable to access the app for online transactions. Please improve
After the update, the app keep crashing and pop up said "server error, unable to connect to server". This has been going for weeks and I can't use duitnow for most of my purchases and transfer which is frustrating. Why the update bring down the app instead of "fixing the bug" like the update state. I'm mortified and scared at the thought my account can be easily hacked while the app crashing.
Much more worst. I cannot login to my acc and usually if i want to login, it always pop out 'high volume of traffic.' what-
why need to relaunch the app for confirmation in online transaction, seriously then it stuck just loading forever. please fix asap ! edit : if i can give 0 star i will give it, have been use for a long time and theres no imrprovement in this app, what are you doing? cant this app be like other bangking app?
Forced to stay hungry the whole day without money because app is down & online banking down, and contactless card transaction cannot be used. I really hate this bank.
Looking forward for better online service. This apps too slow for loading and frequent error issue on server.
too slow and laggy. sometimes need to wait for a long time to login. when to approve transaction even took a long time. please improve tremendously your app bank islam.
Every time update new version. Making it more complicated in all ways. Fingerprint can't access, face recognition take times, need 2 times key in password, auto log out, buffering at all the time until i sleep and wake up on the next day and still buffering. Neither use android or ios, the experience of using is still the same, getting worse.
The worst banking apps... Always loading for so long. Had to do everything in website since the apps is always having prob.
App paling useless. Susah nk access, loading then lastly tak boleh nk buka pun.
Too slow to load in login page. I want to use urgently QR Pay yesterday.
i think no star for this application. very bad. so stress use this. take so long time to open. difficult to transfer/payment. waste time!!
Slow and this app should be optional, not users need to download your app just to use your services. Make it optional.
Worse bank app ever. Can't event log in. Take so much time to load around 5-10 minutes. Pls fix. I'm a student so it's hard for me to pay some stuff
App keeps getting crash and error for login. Please please fix this. Even nak bukak online punya kt website pun slow sangat ya. Do something to fix this asap.
Ever since the Error 500 appeared, the app collapsed and unable to be open. Tried deleting cache, data, force stop it but nothing works. I wanted to do simple transactions using DuitNow but I can't. Uninstalling and reinstalling is a lot of work because you have to setup your account back.
Why remove the option to make transactions using the website? Seems like another unnecessary application that you must download for basic banking service. At least give us a choice!
It has been almost a week i cant access to my account. Last week was due to huge traffic. Today, unable to connect to server.
Please fix this app. It is annoying when you need to transfer money urgently but this app takes tooooooo longgggg loading. Very bad app.
Really slow. I can't stress this enough. My patience is running even thinner every time I need to use this app. Why we need to authorise from the app when the app is this slow? I looked at your replies to the other users and they're just the same things being said over and over again. It really shows that you don't care about us. I already cleared the cache and uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but still can't even log in. I've done the best that I can, so why can't you guys do the same?
Super slow, super clunky, super inefficient
Bad..Cannot even open the app..many times say 'Currently under maintenance'. Hard to do transactions. Please fix the issue.
I cant open this apps after update!!!previous better than this!!! Fix it!!!
Unable to install ..only able to open using playstore then problem to do transfer ..I think this is worst app ever then other bank ...please do something
Very slow app, it take a long time just to open the app and most of the time i cannot access the app at all.
Deserves no star. The worst app for a bank. Loading too long. Always lag and crash. Serioulsly this app needs improvements
Where is the menu to view transaction signing? Adding or deleting favorite accounts has become difficult! If you click on the Transaction Signing notification bar while using the apps, it won't redirect to the correct page to approve the transaction. And there is no way to view the current Transaction Signing! Inbox messages cannot be clicked too! Disappointing! This apps is only good to view the current balance, that's all!
Among the dumbest feature with this apps is they didnt let me screen shot due to privacy policy THIS JUST REALLY EXTREMELY BOTHERING ME, I CANT SHARE MY PAYMENT PROOF BECAUSE I FORGOT TO SHARE THE PDF FILE AFTER I PAID MY SELLER AND I PROCEED TO HOME SCREEN END UP CANT TAKE SCREENSHOT ANYWHERE WITHIN THE APPS? WHY CIMB APPS DIDNT DO THIS? SO WHY WOULD YOU?
Can't login since yesterday. Already updated the app. 🤬
why this apps can't screenshot.. I can't give any proof too seller when i buy some thing when transfer the money. and this app always hank, then must uninstall n reinstall again n again..
No star for a bad apps. Im 1st time want to register. Cannot open at all and just appeared server error!!
Hello, I can't open my apps to check my account. It just said server error. Even the website can't be open. Please fix it.
I can't log-in to the app using my new phone. I have been installing and uninstalling the app for many time but the problem keep on going. Whenever I try to log-in, the app suddenly close. Like when i fill up my bank id and it started loading then the app close and it went back to my phone homepage. I tried many time and I nearly reach to the final step, but it still suddenly close. Please solve this problem quickly cause it is inconvenience to make a transactions thru the website. Thank you.
Always load for a very long time especially when I'm trying to make transaction causing the transaction to be cancelled.
one of the worse performing online banking app with multiple downtimes and bugs
Worst. Always encountered Server Error Unable to connect to the server. What should I do then???
After i updated, i cnnot log into the app anymore!
Makin Update, Makin teruk. Kena clear data storage setiap kali nak launch app ni...
Loading screen took so long and keep getting error message . Sometime biometric also cannot use .
A very unreliable piece of technology. Takes forever to go to login page, and sometimes even fail. I have to clear cache and storage then reopen to see the login page. To transfer money, the bank require the GO authorization but when you cannot even open the app and login this will make it useless. I suggest to first remove the need for GO authorization and stick to 6 digit codes until you guys fix the issues for your app. 1 star review overall is not a very good look for the brand. Best of luck
Cant open the app, it stuck on loading screen
Dear developer, This app always stuck on login. When log in to app, I cannot log in to other browser. I want transfer my money to pay for the thing i buy. Fix this god dam stupit mf apps lah weh. Learn from MAE, CIMB Click and others.. Developer lena ka..
Fix this app at least please. Cannot take screenshot for proof of payment. And loading , took forever. Apps is not so friendly user.
Need to approve transaction in app, app forever loading. At least give option for sms code for fak sake. Might actually change bank just because of this app
Please fixed this apps, it was not stable sometimes I can login using fingerprint sometime its cannot..if I can put 1/2 star ..that is your rating I can give to your app
Been using this app for years and it was smooth. But after recent update, it just went from good to worst! Whenever i tried to login, keep on pop-up 'unable to reach server'. Super annoying! Then i uninstall and re-install, looks fine but when i keyin my ic number, it detect as error. U guys please fix it asap.
By far the worst banking app. Always auto logged out due to the server issue. And to login will require few attempts which is ridiculous. The UI is bery basic and sometimes a bit confusing for example hard to notice which one is required field. Why don't you just suggest to re-install the app? BIMB User. Person_A: can just transfer me the money. Me: Great! Lemme uninstall and install this wonderful banking app.
problem app,i cannot open the apps for swveral times
Such a nuisance/ problematic/ inconvenient apps..need to do transaction asap, but not able to open apps or even online banking..what a turndown..improve la bank islam
I don't know what's wrong with Bank Islam app anymore. Previous version is more stable, easy and user-friendly. And now? Double menyusahkan users.
0.5 star if i can put here. The worst apps for banking. I cant even open the apps properly to accept the transaction. Just keep the tac style laa, dont copy other banking apps. Haiyaaa!
The worst online banking apps Ive used. It took forever just to load. Then another forever to load any payment methods.
Better than Road Runner . Just imigine.
The function of this apps make so difficult to transfer my money to make payment for my car n my grab n all my apps.. Why this apps took so long to loading. 2 days waiting n still loading.. Do something bnk islam why so weak
Shouldn't have given a star. First of all this is inconvenient at all. The website is much more better. I'm trying to do a single transaction over days but still can't. Go to 'Go secure' put in the digits still NOTHING. The needs to log in everytime and then the apps log out suddenly when making transaction so irritating. Plus the 'not valid' when literally just a second after log in. A single transaction but this much troubles is so frustrating. It's making me lost temper everytime.
Very bad. App is not working. Even after update. Any other way to do online transfer now?
I have been using the app for more than a year (maybe) and there have been massive improvements, kudos to the developers 👍🏻 I'm looking forward to future improvements especially in these 3 aspects - a more friendlier GUI (not too robot-ish please), a more complete/comprehensive transfer experience and frequent updates to fix the bugs. Additionally I have a question, the ability to add fav transfers is actually also not available on other banking apps, is it for security reasons?
I want to transfer money urgently but they asked to download the go bank apps. The darn app cannot even be accessed. Failed to connect to server. Wth
This is the worst app ever. I can't even tap go secure how do I want to transfer for online banking, this is so annoying
Worst app, always loading and high volume traffic. Need approvement and be like a maybank app easier to people. Go to online banking site also same.
The app suddenly cannot open , it say server error.. Already tried to uninstall and install back but still same. Why ahhh ayoooooooooo
System always down .. very hard to make online transaction . if this have ZERO star , i will rate this . Its been years !
Almost there with BSN with the most inefficient banking service in Malaysia. Useless apps / online platform every end of the month
Cant even access the apps..transfer through website but it to go to the apps to be able to transfer..but everytime i want to access cant even enter the apps..the apps always problem..
Pleaseeeeee update the app to be faster.I am really annoyed using this app.the login session itself took about more than one minute.please change your technical team or hire the better new team ASAP!
Apps are so slow and annoying. I keep getting access denied. Please improve it.
This app does not deserve even one star. Keep loading until forever cannot be used, always in high traffic issue.
not a good bank app. Loading for very long time. Got problem when to buy stuff on shopee & when i want to topup my internet. I can't take it anymore
Wouldn't even give this app a single star if I could. You forced us to use this app for such security reason but didn't even manage to even come with a good apps. Please do some quick improvements
The previous version is better. The current app is so slow and annoying. Please fix this ASAP!
The server always got error, please fix it! I can't even log in to my account because of that!
The apps is definitely less convenient than the website. But, nothing out of expectation. Because depending on the data you use the loading time of the apps may be slower or faster. Sometimes cannot use it because it was under maintenance but definitely not because of the apps itself if unable to use it. It also depends on your phone specs and storage. 😉
Getting worst day by day.Make it verify on the app after using the web for transaction.But the app was not working properly and immidiate urgent transaction all getting delay.
CAN'T USE AT ALL. LOADING FOR A LONG TIME THEN ERROR. TRIED UNINSTALL THEN REINSTALL BUT SAME RESULT. ITS BEEN ALMOST A WEEK. PLEASE FIX IT IMMEDIATELY. THANK YOU. IM A LONG-TIME USER
This app make me spoil to do on9 transaction still cannot use and so bad to me,ples take action to solve this problem ASAP to give and make excellent app for easy to use tq
Now can't even open app. Keeps saying high volume of traffic and tell us to try again later. EPIC FAIL
Slow n loading. Apa punya app laaaa. Buatla sesuatu.
Please improve service quality.. cannot be relied upon much needed.. it suck... The worse apps ever.. Do you guys don't have the person that can handle this ke . Shame lah .. Bank lain ada apps, bank hang pun nak buat apps .. buat lah betul betul.. buat kerja dengan kaki ke?
Please do fix your app. I been try to open the app to pay via QR. Its been 2 hours trying to open it. Still fail to do so. Soo emberassing when want to buy something and pay using QR.
We were forced to use this app for our online transactions. But this app caused alot of problem. Server error. Cant connect to the server. Etc. Please Bank Islam don't so unprofessional. Dont cause your customers alot problems. Must I keep on unistalling and then reinstalling again to use your app? People complained but its look as if there is still no improvement. The customers still have had difficulties to use this app. So frustrated
This bank app is by far the worst. It's very slow to load, at least 2 mins at the loading screen. I am not exaggerating! Crashes all the time. Verification details sometimes doesn't appear. Seriously, how does a relatively big bank have such an app? I sincerely hope a major improvement is done soon!
Why won't you take action eventho you have 1.2 ratings? Is user satisfaction not important? This app take too much times to load that makes it harder for any transaction especially after 'go secure' features. If you made an app that is this slow you should just use TAC number. Don't bother request for a rating if your company don't take action at all.
VERY BAD experience. The switching between the acc is so not user-friendly. And now I have a problem to access my company acc because of "invalid credential". I need an urgent transfer and now THIS. If you want to make every transfer more secure by doing this, please make sure the app is good-enough. I hope to see the improvements. Pleasseee...
I cannot access this app as the app unable to connect with the server. I hope this thing can be settle asap.
Terrible! Worst online banking I've ever had. Kasi tutup sajalah app!
The app is soo buggy. It just keep on loading after opening the app. If it didn't stuck loading, it will take a few minutes for it to finish loading and show the login screen. What's the point of having an app if it much more of a hassle to use. By far the most horrible banking app i ever used.
Please improve your user experience. App cannot open and cannot approve any transaction. What is the point of having the app if cannot be open
many times unable to load and log in . bank islam please upgrade your services apps
Everytime nak guna, had to wait flipping long time, the berudu keep spinning infinitely. Please improve BIMB
Not recommended tbh. After the recent update, it logged me off and I had to re-register into the app and it crashed after inputting the security code. Many. Times. There's also instances where it kept having issues even before this. And here I thought the octopus app is bad, but this is next level of terrible.
Dah uninstall, lepas tu install balik but still tak boleh bukak pun apps. Bad services.
Sehari semalam dah cuba log in. Asyik loading jaaaaaaa. I dont know when will this apps function well. Always unable to log in. Worst bank apps ever.
very bad experience. after a year uninstalled this app, still no improvement. teruk sangat, please improve lah!!!!!!
The worst app ever..i got the same issue with others..this app became very bad, take time to log in and slow than before..
It's been a week now and the app can't be opened at all. I can't even log in the system. Please fix this issue ASAP
What wrong with your apps recently? After updating the system suddenly i cannot open it at all?!?! Fix it faster please. This issue have not being fixed even after more than 1 week. Dissapointing. It have been very convenient to use it past few years but not anymore. I can't even open it now!
An annoying incompetent app. I can't even get to the log in page, it just keeps on uselessly loading for eternity. The most infuriating thing is that every transaction needs GO authorization, so I'm just here unable to pay my student debt for months. If you're going to make it so important at least make it usable at the very least. FIX IT.
To much buffering. Server need to be upgrade to ensure system running smooth. Nak transfer duit pun payah. Kalau server down notify la customer. Bukan duduk diam je. Ni every hour nak try login utk access tp error sama je. Takkan notify pun ego juga.
Terrible. It used to be the most handy app for transactions. Now i can't even get through the login page. What happened BIMB?? Apps are supposed to make online banking easier but this is the other way around. It has been going on for months now eversince the most recent update. Would very much appreciate if your team can find the problem and fix it asap!
Always have bug n need to be updated.so annoying
Why so much problem lately with Bank Islam apps? Can't even authorize payment and error pops APZ_TSN_0001 transaction is expired (when it is not)
Bad and terrible. The most annoying baking app ever. U don't understand how it can be worser than it was already is. The loading takes far too long and then suddenly cannot login anymore. The go secure is not available to approve anything, can't even click and always error.
Can i know how long you are making this app to loading.. I'm waiting for a long time to open this application.. Please make it faster to open or don't have any loading app
Worse experience of all banking app. Please make good old times TAC than using fully method GO app. I can't even launching the app
What is the purpose to force your customers to use unstable application service? It's very hard to open the application and how will it looks for us when we need to pay instant in front of a counter? Is this another type of promoting method for encourage your customers to change bank?
Takes forever to load the Ui, fingerprint login failed most of the time, lots of server errors and incomplete displayed infos. *Using a good phone w high speed data and more than decent urban speed, screen sensor works in every other app enabled fingerprint access. So, IT'S THE APP & SERVER. And....did the switch off on phone,clear cache, reset data, uninstall reinstall stuffs. So..Yeah.
Worse experience with new version apps. Bank islam take very long time to solve the apps problems. Very disappointed 😔
It's been two weeks since the latest update and the same problem hasnt been solved, 'unable to connect to server', unable to log in. The only solution that they can provide is 'please reinstall', 'please use the lastest version' as if we havent done it before. Very disappointing. Would rate a zero if I could.
very incredibly slow ive never seen an app this slow fix it even with good internet connection it keeps lagging and takes forever to load
I am okay with the Apps, it is easy to use and I have no issue of logging into the Apps. The only problem that I encountered is receiving the IAC. I have to request new IAC at least twice everytime when performing online transactions (it took me longer time to complete just a transfer). Please advise. Thanks.
App paling mudah nak pakai... Sometime problem.. Tp masih better than others
Worst banking apps. Changing transaction limit should not take too long to be effective. Lol
Not supposed to be any star. The worst app ever. Not user friendly, not worth having it. I can't even make any transaction via online or the app. If not 'no service' its either 'error' for whatever reason. Worst of all it say session exp. Like what the F!! I just open the thing like few seconds ago. Keep logout for no reason too. It was easier before if I need to pay immediately or for emergency now it take almost a whole day just to make 1 transaction.
Just to login need a lot time of waiting. How to make transaction with this kind of problem. Make thing more complicated
I thought making an app should ease the users, not make it more difficult. Its annoying that every time the app has an issue need to uninstall and reinstall back app or update it, and bimb doesn't send notification on updates of the app or app issue so its really hard to know what's the problem. The website page is much more easier to use compare to the app.
Apps paling slow antara online banking . Please upgrade. Penat nk tnggu loading
I have to give two stars only as for now the transactions that can only be use in the app confirmation to do any transactions online like buying from Shopee and it take a lot of time for user to be able to do that stuff then before that more faster which is using an old way which is receiving the TAC code. It also take a lot of attempts to make the transactions successfully completed. I hope Bank Islam can improve this con/problem as fast as it could. That all from me. Thank you.
Improved a lot but still can improve for better.
Why can't take the screenshot? I tried to take a few screenshots but still can't..
Worse, app loading very slow.. money transfer also late. Sometimes i pay double just because this app very slow
It was easy navigation & functioning really good before, but now just to log in I have to try 3-4 times, then after log in, to do transaction also it keeps on loading until the session expired. Is it safe anymore. Please do something, before I change my banks. Dont ask me to make a report again, just read this & do something quick. Bank should be reliable & secure!!
For the 4th time I'm writing this review until the dev team can fix the bug. So here goes, I got stucked at the loading screen even when I'm connected to the internet. After loading, it goes to the 'good afternoon' page, it was a blank page, no button or whatsoever, got stucked there. Uninstall the app and installed it again, same thing happened. I can conclude this app is non functinal and utterly useless. Step up your game and learn from MAE ;)
Stuck at login page and never got through. Been having the problem for the last 2 months. After the new update, it gets worse. Now, could never use the app, have to use the browser version. In process of transferring all my funds into another bank, because their app dont give me this kind of problem. Thanks.
You guys need to do something about this app. It keeps crashing, no matter how many times reinstall the app. This is one of the most important channel to do transactions, yet it happens to be so lagged, not responsive and keep popping error. Afraid that u r losing customers, sir.
After update the latest version the app doesn't open at all & not supporting. Once the app open, it automatically close it by itself. It's vry difficult to perform any transactions & need to use chrome or desktop. The problem has been continued for more than 3 weeks. Regretting for updating the latest version😒
the survey always have a problem, always be dragging my time, always crashing like everytime i wanna make a payment, what do you guys even doing? by just keep updating the app but the app are stil the same with the old problems? what a waste of time. All of the reviews from the users have been stating the same problem but nothing changed. Do your work properly by fixing the bug and so on. My connection doesn't have a problem but the app are just horrible. Do what you need to do. PLEASE FIX THIS
So far so good. Maybe take a look into the back button function, it's better to not directly logout, just instead go back to the previous screen. Same as most of users, the biometric login doesn't work. And when will the DuitNow will be integrate into the GO app? Much easier to transfer money if it is available.
Although to the internet connection is strong the apps remain weak as usual. It will take at least 15 minutes most of the time use the apps services. Sometimes to even open the apps it will take too much time. Hopefully, this can be resolved quickly as it will waste a lot of time especially for those who were in rush because of their jobs or important matter.
The app was superb but not anymore. The last update really messed this app up. It has been a week or more since it can be accessed. Now, it keeps telling server error every time the app is opened. I don't see any immediate fixed on this one ever since. Very disappointed. I'm giving one star for now.
The worst bank that I have used ever. 1. When open the bank app, it shows loading icon for 2-3 minutes before enter into the next page. 2. Many times when I do online transaction, Go secured does not respond or announce "transaction failed" etc... has always wasted my time & energy to try to uninstall & reinstall then re-login 3. Stupid main page that shows the account balance BIG & BOLD, which make has no sense of privacy at all.
This is the worst banking app I have ever used. Lately it has been almost useless. Takes ages to to work, not to mention the endless moments of frustration when it displays 'high traffic volume', among others. At shop checkout I often keep other customers waiting while waiting for the app to work, if at all . What a shame for a bank. With the all the bad reviews I don't see the problems solved. Please don't keep telling users to clear cache or what not...I am sure they do that all the time.
Update, it is getting worse, I cant access my account at all. When I logged in it just load then straight up logged me out. I cant access my account at all and the "Server Error" keep on popping up. This app should make it easier for me to transfer money etc but now, I have to use the website. This happens after I updated the app.
Since the start of my usage of GO, I realise the loading time has always been very slow. Frequently javing server error or simply an error to connect. Its like, almost all cashiers at my local stores would describe to me anyone who uses the white/red app is a bad choice and the yellow or Blue app, is the right choice. MasyaAllah how can this be persistent for almost half a year now. Im sure you all have your Tech team. If the interface has problems, whatabout the security, is it questionable too
App always hang and I need to always reset the ibanking because for some reason, they keep telling me I got the credentials wrong. Resetting password is also another issue and always in circles. End up with the issue not resolved. Overall disappointed with the app, the website is more or less the same as well. Only a matter of time for me to close my BIMB account.
App is very slow. Most of the time I can't even log into the app as it just keeps on loading for a very long time. Don't tell me to clear cache, clear storage, reinstall bla bla bla. I'VE TRIED AND IT JUST DOESN'T WORK. Very frustrating. This problem has been going on since last year. Seems to me like they didn't want to take initiative to fix the issue.
The apps become useless if you are in need-to-hurry situation. It takes so much time to load the first page before can use the service. A lot of time, its faster to open browser and go to the site compare to using the apps itself. Then, it defeats the purpose of having the apps in the first place.
Why is it that everytime on salary day, I can't open the app? I had to uninstall & install again. It just get annoying because I need to set up again from the start. The app itself is easy too use, so i wish this would be resolved quickly. Edit (3 May): The developer response to my email regarding my issue pretty quickly, even tho I email them late at night... So, kudos. Improve my rating. Still cannot actually give 5 star la cuz still not perfect.
Always problem when open...buffering until forever
The app is slow and always loading and failed to enter. Everytime i want to make transaction, i need to uninstall and reinstall the app. Can you do something about this? It's such a hassle to uninstall and reinstall every single time when i need to do transaction. Update based on reply by admin : I have never experience this problem with other bank app. I don't have to clear cache to enter any other bank app.
Since the new update, opening the apps is impossible. Always gets stuck at the log in page. Have uninstalled and installed so many times, but the issue of being stuck at log in page is still the same. It makes it difficult to use the GO app to make payments or transactions.
Garbage app, keep getting "Server Error, unable to connect". The website was working fine before and now you need the app to approve duitnow transfers. Why fix thing that was not broken? When you are able to actually access your account, navigation within the app is also sluggish and slow. It takes forever to just do a simple transfer. Seriously considering closing my bank islam account and migrate to a better service.
Why the app is so slow? When I opened the app, the loading animation will play like forever. Can't access the app at all. I have already cleared the cache, I have cleared the data, didn't work. I have uninstalled and installed the app again, worked but only the first time login. Next time I want to login this thing happened again. The app used to work properly now what happened? It has been like this since middle of last year. Were there no fix?
I can't log-in to the app using my phone. I have been installing an uninstalling the app for many time but the problem keep on going. I try to log-in the app suddenly close. I tried to many time and i nearly reach to the final step, but its suddenly close. Please solve the problem quickly. Thank you.
Been using this app over a year. While it has it's drawbacks over its competitors, GO is definitely an upgrade over the old system where you need to access your account from your browser. The app's responsiveness is a bit lacking but overall it achieved its basic functionality.
Very poor apps. Once installed, tried to sign in a few times. Each time it says server problem. Finally was able to sign in. But the balance shown is zero which is impossible coz the would definitely ask me to close the account. Tried again later. Same thing. Zero balance. So decided to uninstall. Please look at other banks app especially maybank. It's much more friendlier.
Please do something, it's not easy to log in, sometimes can, at some times cannot. Already done the clear cache step n using mobile network, reinstall a few times n it's still the same. It's very annoying as we need to use apps for higher amount transaction. Why bother update the apps when the previous version is much better??
Always unable to access the system due to server error or unable to connect to server. I have tried almost everything including switching from data to wifi, but still not working. The app is very inconvenient. Please do something about it.
UX is good enough but need some improvement. Eg, the fingerprint approval for duit now. After logged in to the system with finger print must have approval again but of on main menu no need. Wierd isn't it? Overall, the app was good but feels unpolished and inconsistent. Maybe can ask for more budget for app development next time. If development is on the way then can wait to try.
Cannot log in the apps since day 1 after set up. Install and uninstall few times also. Logging in always error "APZ_TSN_0003" came up. Tried both Mykad / IC number with and without dash "-" but still unable to log in. Tried using home secured wifi as well as phone own internet data but not successful - same error code number came up. Not sure how to rate this apps. However , using the same usename, same password for internet banking - works fine and able to perform all transaction needed.
Please fix your apps! I'm getting difficulties to view the accounts. If let say the network is unstable and the apps lost connection, User not able to logout. When I re-login again, looks like I need to wait for another 24 hours!!!! Open account with you wasting my time. Poor apps services, just like BSN.
I've been having issues logging in since 3weeks now, been reinstalling the apps many times but the same problems keep showed up "couldn't connect to the server" "high network trafficking, too many users" bla3. But even up until today, the app wont fix. It was working perfectly fine before the update, now it has become haywire & I can't do cashless transactions no more. Pls fix the app ASAP developer?!
Oh ya guys, about the "unable to connect to server" problem, i think you guys should uninstall the application, and then install again. I think it worked out for me. I'm not sure if it works for you, but can give it a try ☺️. I saw the notice on the website, i think it supposedly to work like that.
It's not really functional. The fingerprint doesn't work and the app keep getting frozed. I kept installed and reinstalled but still the same. Theres a time that it can be use and there's a time that can't. I have to use the old fashion way which is via web page key in manually to log in. Please take note and fix it as internet banking is very important nowadays.
I don't understand. It's so weird, where this time I updated the app. Later, when I logged in, there's noti pop up saying it needs a change in permission setting which I really don't understand what's that permission for. Previously, it mentioned about accessing my location, which I refused to. Then, my app didn't work.
Very very bad app, sorry Bank Islam but you shouldn't make an app if it's not giving convenience to the users. The problem is not even with the interface but the server itself - very long loading time, easily crashed, can't function properly, can't take high traffic, etc. Please fix it, you're losing users' trust!
This time I had to re install the apps. Once installed I am able to go in and used the apps. But after logging out and tried to re enter, I am unable to go in. It seems that the icon save on phone screen is not responding when I touched it. Sorry no screenshot. Already installed and uninstalled several time.
It's a good app but I hope the developer can link the internet banking history and mobile banking history and make it into one single history list. Plus, I cannot download the receipt of transaction I made. Even there is a download button, it's for all transaction. Not details. Just able to screenshot only.. So, whenever I need to do important/formal transaction I need to open internet banking instead of just use the app.
I can forgive if an app is slow, but this app is downright unusable. App takes forever(literally never ending time) to load and would sometimes crash mid transaction. Hopefully there will be a new version of this app that can go toe to toe with competitors.
It's really frustrating that lately it's taking so damn long to load the app.. at first i though it was a problem with my internet connection but all of my friends that are using this app also experience the same thing.. idk what's wrong with the system but please fix it.. it's hard to use cashless payment method if it's always taking so long to load like this..
Latest system makes my bill payments delay because I need to be logged out for some time before I can log in again in another application. Quite a hasle. If it is for safety reasons, I think your team need to figure out other way around. Not everyone have the leisure to make bills payment on separate occasions.
This app is a fail. Not just it takes too long to load every pages, its not even functioning well. I once make a interbank transfer and the status is pending! I tried again using website and it works fine. So i had to call the customer service to report about it and it took almost a week to get refund. Worst experience ever. I should've stick to using website.
Please upgrade or update your system. System lag and work very slowy even with high speed internet. Very difficult to make online transactions. Mine always has system error and i cannot log into my account. It has been continuing for few month already. Getting security code is also a problem as i was always getting late msg.
After reading several previous previews, I personally endured the same problem which is, unable to log in using the apps. Seems like no improvement to curb the problem. Another issue which I noticed is that using the internet banking method, the steps are confusing. Why can't you simplify ways and methods.
This apps stop working since 1week right when we need most! It keeps showing SERVER ERROR no matter I use WiFi or mobile data! Before that, this apps was not "internet friendly" bcoz it only needs high speed mobile data instead of basic data. However,even I used WiFi still not working and only 1@2 times,I can use after waiting more than 10mins loading!! And now, completely not working! I wish I can give zero star to this apps.
After updating the apps, I cannot log in to my account as the server keep saying unable to connect to the server which is very inconvenient. This is not the first time it happens but almost every time when update the apps. It's not ok as the apps should be more better to user after updating not making it worst. Really sad though.
Always unable to access into this apps with error msg appeared as "due to high traffic". I suppose the bank should be happy and expecting the high traffic as the mark of trust from the user. Please fix it.. to be honest, both apps and website version. I have headache with both today, and customer service always unreachable due to the high numbers of call.
Your app is poorly optimised and not efficient to be used. Apps takes more than a minute to open up. It takes extra minutes just to do a simple transaction. Sometimes, it logout without my consent (While using the app). Please improve and see how other competitors have better mobile apps experience. 🙄 I m complaining because I was forced to use this bank because of my scholar and I don't like the experience so far.
After recent update (date of update release 11/11/2022), the app can't be access at all and it been days, days that it shows "Server error" failure even though my data connection is stable and all. Repeating the step to try again doesn't matter because the same error window keep popping and restrict access into this app. Thankfully your website doesn't crash like this tho but still 🙁
"unable to connect to the server" this thing happen so many time. should repair it immediately or just throw this apps. how many times to clear cache as you said but things happen badly i still cannot login and the same message appear "unable to connect to server". trying to uninstall and reinstall but same problem occur. really dissappointed
The app is always unstable. It took too much time to load and sometimes it couldn't open at all. Please fix it. Things that were supposed to be done easily & quickly will turned out to be a complete disaster. I like to go cashless so I need the app to be available easily all the time
Thing is, I had great difficulty to establish whether this is a legit app or not. I only noticed the previous version was no longer functioning and found this Go app in the Play store. Checked in BIMB website and still no mention of this new app superseding the old one. My advise to BIMB is to be more professional when handling digital content. Make an official announcement in the website about any new digital app or way of handling.
Couldn't log in since about a week ago. Got 'unable to connect to server' error. Tried many times on different days. Same problem. Cleared cache, cleared data, same problem. Uninstalled, reinstalled fresh with the latest version, still couldn't log in. Please advise a solution ASAP as I see many other users facing the same problem. I am using Android.
I've been using this app for 2+ year or so, no problem that really concern me before beside some little bug, but after a several update last year this apps is useless, always loading at the start up screen, now i cannot use duitnow transfer, this happen to me when i'm at supermarket queing to pay my groceries but the apps won't load at all, now i have to go to atm machine to withdraw cash, please fix this problem fast!
Its very frustrating, the system always down, the apps always have problem to scan the qr code or even to log in. Recently, when using the visa card to pay, it deducted twice even the transaction is unsuccessful and it not only happened to me but happen to my other family and friends. Please do better to maintain your customer loyalty
Yesterday I installed it in my phone and it performed well. But today it suddenly freezes out and I can't login to my account. Whenever I've already entered the password and proceeded, it shows my account loged out. I tried to uninstall and install it back but it works the same. I tried using the online banking website and it surprised me by telling that I don't have user account. Today is a Sunday and the branches aren't working, so I would have one day without transactions? What a big trouble!
Having problem to access my acc. The app kept loading and giving notification to use web. But when i tried login through web, it says i am already logged in due to the app despite the app already been closed. Tried to go back to the app, i got access denied! Been in constant loop going back and forth. This is very frustrating! The app got worst upon update.
Couldnt open the apps. Delayed all my tasks. New comments: I noticed that the problem occurs when I use wifi. Once I switched to my mobile data the apps works just fine. Wonder why. I hope the developer can look into this issue. Thanks Another new comments: app asked for udpates. After updates needs to re-register. Continue to fail to register after more than 5 attempts (tries in different days and time, install uninstall, restarting phone). Please, can developer do something about it...
As the apps ALWAYS server error, I decided to use the web instead.. Unfortunately, any online transaction i need to approve via this non-functional app too. In the end, I need to opt for another banking account instead. It's time to terminate my account, i guess. What's the point if the online platform can't be used during this digital era.
13/1/23-Endless loading when i opened the app. Might be because the new update, at least around that time. . . 15/1/23-Work okay so far after reinstall it. For others who did not know, the app only work on single device. In my case, I used the app on multiple device before, and just realise it only can use on one device at a time, this maybe for user security too.
After update the apps, worst and the apps is very hasle and time consuming to deal with. Apps keep crashing and always appear "unable to connect" and take time for login. Feel very dissapointed and frustating to us while using this apps. Each time upgrade it still slow and please ensure the apps is easily convience for us to use.
This app starts to get slower and slower. Can't even share receipt to whatsapp for whatever reason. Whenever i try to scan qr code from my gallery, the app restarts itself and sometimes I can't scan my finger print for faster log in. Even if i do get to scan my finger print, it takes ages to load. I dont know why so please fix this app.
I barely can log in. The LOADİNG was always taking forever! When it does logged in, every single click to proceed with different services will take another LONG LOADİNG and most of the time I got kicked out or the time sessions expired before I could complete them! 😔 Please do fix it or I have no option but use another online banking 🙃!
The transition is a bit slow & login with biometric also slow. I wish that the app will improves the swiftness of transition from one page to another & also, i hope it never neglect user's security in all aspects. Keep on improving.
Salam. I faced the problem in log in. After key in the correct User ID, the apps seems crash and instantly back to phone menu. I do refer to the nearest branch and contact center but they could not give a solution to the problem. They always said to have up to date apps n for sure i did update the apps. The branch officer said mybe my phone the old version phone n the storage was full....hellooooo!!! I dont have any problem with my acc as i still can access via browser but cant do in bimb go.
Website is much more stable to use, and more reliable. Now the server is down, and I don't know why. I like using it to do transfers and DuitNow QR, even checking balance often. Please fix this soon. But the SecureGO is inconvenient, I had a crash once and I cannot approve payment. Maintain the SMS codes for the website, unless the transaction is through the app.
I got kicked out from the apps when I try to log in. And ive been trying for many times. I think it's not just me, everyone else also face the same problem. Please fix this. It's troublesome to use the website but that's the only option since this apps does not works well. Thanks
I cant share the pdf of my transaction, i thought it was just a bug, that will be fixed after an updates, already went through 2 updates but still not fixed? There also no sections for troubleshooting or somewhere that let u ask when u have a problem with the app. The app was fine until i cant download my pdf. Its just too inconvenience to people using the app.
Couldn't log in to this app, and apparently there's update available. Tried to update but pending for hours. So I uninstalled the apps, restart my phone and tried to re-install. But until now it's still pending installation. I don't have any problem updating/installing other apps. So now I don't even have the apps, and have to login in web version
Was working fine until one day it just decided to give up on me. I can't access my account It just gives me a loading screen. I thought reinstalling it might help, but nope. Now it just shows me the Get Started page every time. When I click on it, only blank screen is shown.
Very bad. Everytime open the apps, the system will loading and buffering. In one day this happens quite all the time. Problem is transaction above RM200 needs secure confirmation from the apps but the apps cannot be openned. WORST WORST WORST internet banking apps. Please improve otherwise people will not put money in your saving account.
The performance is really bad. It always dissapointed to open the app as almost all the time it was not function. Already reinstall to many times, but it still same after a few days. Please make it the performance as previous. Previously, it was really easy to access this apps.
I have worst experience with this new updated apps. I already update my phone, my phone is still new. Already clear cache. Already switch to mobile data or wifi but i still experiencing loading error and server error. I dont how to give feedback anymore. Already uninstall and install it back but still doesn't solve the problem that i experienced. You guys have to take this seriusly 😌 if you want to make an apps you have to make sure it user friendly and usable. Dont make us frustrated
Unable to open the apps at all after setting up on the phone. Everytime have to install and reinstall. When i use the website, require the GO aunthentication, but cannot open the apps. Keeps on loading and crashing. Before this the apps is more stable. Please fix this fast. Its so hard to do transaction.
Had problem login with fingerprint, developer responded to reenable the Quick Touch and it works now. On another matter, there's a lot of work to be done if they want to compete with other mobile banking apps but for its current iteration, I think it's quite good.
What is wrong with this app? I've been using bank Islam for a year now but only the previous version worked and not the latest one😡 It kept showing server and stuck on loading screen everytime I opened it! I also uninstall and reinstalled it several times but still not working😡👎🏻 what the heck?(edit: Now it became extremely slow😡 why?! So annoying!!)
Lagging. Takes too long to even open the apps. Even if it's not peak hour or date or whatever. Biometric fingerprint doesn't usually available. An app is supposed to be convenient and efficient. You lack both.
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME! A month & counting, no progressive updates from developer! I've tried everything you asked for, reinstall the apps but nothing works. Quite a shame, overall quite friendly but not really reliable as to date. Please remove the function of verification via Go if you're not addressing this problem yet. Really wish this can be fix ASAP.
What happen? After logged in, always error pop out.. I've been cleared all the cache many times, uninstall everything and start again.. Yet the issue still happening. This is the worst banking apps ever.. Please get your technical team fix this for the convenience of other customer. You should hire a better apps developer team!
The app is not useful at all as it always crashes or keep loading for a long time. The developer is keep stating that they're improving the app but there's no improvement till now. We as a user can't use the app to do any kind of transaction during emergency time also.
I cannot even open the app. I uninstalled and reinstalled multiple time but it's all the same. I cannot open the app. It keeps loading. I cannot do fund transfers because I am told to approve the transaction on the app, but I cannot open the app. This happened too many times. Do something about the app. Or give us an option for the IAC when we want to do fund transfers
The time taken to load the app was too long and its very inconvinient when I try to make transactions using QRpay. Please improve the user experience as it is used by so many people. Or just try to make a whole different app that's better in every way. Looking foward to that.
Copy & paste function is not available. This is one of the most important features need to be added. The UI/UX design also got problem ; the contrast etc. pls look back at the basic principles of design.
Updated the apps few weeks back and now am not able to screenshot my transaction anymore. I get that we can share it, but if I forgot then there's literally no way to just get them anymore from the app. I need to open in browser and screenshot from there. So much work to do and very annoying.
I wanted to fund transfer to another account. But at the very last page, the app doesn't cross check and display the official name of the recipient account? It simply trusts the recipient's name I put whilst trasnferring? It's terribly unreliable and unsafe. Unproffessional and unbelievable.
Ive been using this app for like half a year or so. Everything was fine until last two days, it required an update so i did and suddenly the app started to take a longer time to respond and open. Not only that, after the loading, it crashed. I feel so mad about this because we already in an era where qr code banking is a must but an app which must fulfill the needs does not function well. Im disappointed.
Worst app ever. Its been 2 months i've tried to access the app but connection server error has been appearing. Please get ur server fixed. It is not user friendly at all. I have to keep on going to the bank to do certain transaction which this was suppose to be made on online instead.
It's been more than a month i still could not login into the app even though after i had uninstall and install it back repetitively. The app keeps on showing error all the time which makes it difficult for me to go cashless. Please fix this as soon possible.
Worst banking app ever. Just opening the app your greeted with loading screen with an infinite loading time. After that when you try login your account you will have to wait again with the loading screen. Your lucky if you even manage to log in even twice a day without any problem. The app is slow when just about to do transaction, QR payment ot changing the settings. Reinstall and clearing the cache is obviously not working. So overall worst banking app ever.
Stuck at loading screen, clear cache then ok for a bit but then stuck again. Why do i need to clear cashe every damn time? DuitNow qr will need to reset transfer limit everytime clear cache. Duitnow qr camera is distorted as if the camera is squeezed. Qr detection is garbage, the scanner will show error message when im not even scanning anything, clicking OK on errror pop up will pop up another failed to scan error message. I only use this app to transfer with duitnow and I cant even do that
Worst experience ever. This is my first time downloading this app. I can't log into the app. The app will turn off or kick me out the app after i try to submit my password.. I tried updating my phone and somehow it worked, I can enter the app, but another problem emerge😅. When I use qr code, it says that i dont have any bank account even though i have one. It even suggested me to register my bank account.
So tired.. the apps keep crashing and it's currently unavailable. When they first release the apps, there's minor problem and it's inconvenient to transfer money but the issue is fixed now. But then now the apps keep crashing and I'm a disappointed user
Cant even log in to the app after last update. Keep saying unable to sync cant connect lah apa lah. Very bad. Such a shame because the app itself is good enough. Just the recent unable to log in stuff so if cannot lon in then what use is an app? I see everyone also struggling with this issue not just me. Fix before i change to another bank
Problem after updating the Apps. Before, i'm not having any problem with the app, but yesterday, after updating the apps, pop up 'unable to connect the server' showing up. No matter how frequent i turn off & restart my handphone, it is still the same. It's getting annoying as i need to make money transaction asap. Preferably i don't want to use the website as i want to transfer to other bank immediately. Please....fix this Bank Islam Go.....
I can't even make a proper transaction without the app lagging on the other end. The app used to be good and was easier to login. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app because it said 'unable to connect to server'. I hope this bug will be fixed as soon as possible.
The loading screen took so long. I can't even enter the login page, yet when I tried to login it will took so long to loading results to " We're having bad traffic " pop-up shown multiple times. Very bad app for multi billionaire company, even the beginner devs can do better application than this one.
Whenever I try to open the app, the words 'Unable to connect to server' pops out and I've been disappointed ever since. Why doesn't it work? Well, that's for the team to figure out and for us to wait in anticipation. So it's best if you GO and do it. Get it? GO and do it? No? Ok. Still frustrated with the app tho. 1 star, very bad.
Another hassle. A whole more inconvenient. You think i need more apps in my phone when a browser can do pretty much everything. No instructions how to start and i can't even get past the login page. Give a damned instructions, a simple one so the not so it savvy can do it too.
The worst and stupidest banking app ever. Logging in takes forever and sometimes can't even logged in. Error messages pop up here and there. Super slow make heart boil everytime I use the app. Why bother develop an app when customer can't even have ease of heart using the app. Worst experience. Period!!!
Currently very very annoyed right now. It has been two days! I cant transfer using the app, and if i want to transfer using the web, they ask to get the verification via the app?? U can just ask for tac no! Two days im stuck!!!! Helloooooo i have bills to pay meney to transfer!!! The apps stated "system is currently unavailable, please try later" and proceed to state " the connection is not secured, request cannot be secured" seriously what kind of connection are u referring to???!!!! Fix this
The app gets very buggy starting on November and I'm always stuck at the loading screen (before the login one). I have uninstalled it once and reinstall it again, but still the problem persists. Fix your app Bank Islam if you really want us users to ditch the web version of it. Even the web version I can't get a receipt after any kind of payment
Current update not working. Everytime I enter the apps, a pop up saying server error occured. This has happened since the last update and I have not be able to login using the apps since then. Please fix the current update so that there will be no more inconvenience later.
The apps is too easy to installed and user friendly. In term of security is quite weak. The most bad thing about this app, it's always have unstable connection, i was unable to access it for few days since its failed to connect to server. 🥲🥲
After the update, it took me few minutes to log in. I open other online bank apps and its working fine. So it's not my internet problem. After waiting few minutes to log in, it log out by itself a few seconds after i log in. It's better to log in into their system via chrome or Firefox rather than use their app. It's hard for users to use this app when in hurry. Please fix this issue please ASAP.
This is horrible. I can't access my account. Wanted to make transaction but needed to change transaction limit, that required me to approve the change in the app but I can't even LOGIN. Uninstalled and installed back..high traffic volume pulak. Don't make an app if you can't do decent maintenance.
App always loading after update last week. Stuck at log in page. Dunno wht happen. I uninstalled the app n install back, the problem cannot solved. I've been use this app since last year but this latest update is so unconvinced. The app should be user friendly with high security but this app totally different. Do something please.
This app is useful but I have problem where it cant be open a lot of times. After I open it, it just keep loading. I have to uninstall and install it back everytime this happen. This could probably be the app needing an update but would like dev to prompt it instead of me reinstalling it everytime. Thanks
The systems are really bad , poor & slow. Seriously , slow to access. Please do update/upgrade. Really bad. Even , i can't log in into my own account it keeps loading. Need some improvement for this. Really disappointed. Today , I've topup for my friend my money has been deducted but he haven't received the topup yet , it shows Succesful but NADA. Hope will see changers without clashing. Thank you 😣
Clearing the cache and reinstalling does nothing, I still cannot access the app since the latest update version. And I had no problem with my WiFi connection. Pls revert back to older version if the newer version is not ready.
Everything with this apps or bank seems to be delayed. Fund transfer has been delayed because of weekend as it is IBG, top-up reload has been delayed because of unknown reason. Been waiting like crazy, if I know about this, it must be much faster to just take out the money from the ATM and settle all of my things at once. Installing this to makes life easier, but seems like that's not the case. Very disappointed.
Interface hard to understand. I want to delete my previous fav acc but cant find the button. I want to direct debit into my TH acc. First, I do it on website but restricted and advised I should download GO apps. Try on apps but cant find the page. Hard to navigate. The only easy one is to transfer money. If I want to managed my acc, its hard to done it on apps. Useless
The most buggy app that I had ever encountered. Slow to start, login problem with error "unable to connect to the server". The only reason I had to install this is because the need for verification from the app for fpx payment. PLEASE, just send TAC code to mobile number instead of needing to use this horrible app. New edit : Is the server for this app even up? I kept having issues with "cannot connect to the server". Seriously just get rid of this trash app if so lazy to maintain the app.
1) No way to make transfer to accounts other than favourite account. 2) Furthermore, addition of a favourite account is not possible through the mobile app, there is no relevant selection to authorise the addition even after being directed from the online banking website. Perhaps a more user friendly way to authorise the addition of a fav account is by sending a code to a verified phone number or email address. Please resolve both issues asap as the app is not user friendly at all at this point.
It is so not convenient. Why bother making an apps if I have to go back to website to add fav acc then go back to apps for transfer? The apps should make it able to all acc. And today I tried to make a transaction to my fav acc list but the transaction is pending. Idk. Maybe it is under maintenance or what?? The money already deduct from acc. It just the process is pending. Help me out. Thanks!
Latest update (Jan2022) - I'm having problem on opening the app from the start. It's weird the app ask me to update to the latest version but when I clicked the UPDATE button it jumped to my playstore and it shows no update since I've set it auto-update. Then, I press BACK, the app seems blank and can't use it at all. Please fix this ASAP. This is getting me worried since I have to check my account frequently.
Good for a start, and alhamdulillah finally what I've been waiting for since first I registered for bank islam. Thank you very much to the developers team on doing this. As I've gone through the reviews, the supports and developer are actively communicating back to the users, so that's a star from me. My comments for the interface is, based on my experience, it's better to have that More Options (six dots in the bottom right corner) to be placed alongside the top-up options on the bottom menu.
I never leave a review on Google Play, but this one, I feel obligated to make one. I have to let everyone know that this is the most useless, yet important apps I've ever download in my life! Everytime I need to make a transfer, I need to open this apps for approval. Yet, the apps kept loading endlessly. Thank you for making my life miserable.
We have to reinstall everytime when need to use this app to get the infinite login loading bugs away. This is the worst app for online banking. And no, don't tell us to reinstall or clear cache or any kind of self troubleshoot ever again. Just go fix your bugs already. 🤦🏻‍♀️
Very poor. Really disappointing because couldn't use it when there's an emergency to do the online transaction.. I even can't open the app it's always showing that server error for past few months.. really hoping that you will improve the system asap :⁠-⁠(
The best banking app ever. Why you might ask ? Because even me, myself couldn't get past through the loading screen, even scammers would not even get through this app too, good job, keep everyone out from entering and using the app. Edit : The suggested "Clear Cache" doesn't even help in this case, tq.
I can't see the amount of my savings in the app compared to the website...I can see the amount😭. As a beginner I totally cried a lot that there's no money in it. Then I checked on website...This app aren't user friendly at all. Please fix this😭🙏.As someone who is new to this definitely confusing ad stressful.
I have been experiencing multiple errors and technical issues with your app many times, in almost every transaction I made. Has been happening almost a year plus now. Reading through the reviews by other users, where some had written the same complaints in few year back, it is quite surprising to know that other than admitting the problems and ensuring an improvement to your customer, there is still no positive changes. Do you think this is funny?
What a worse experience using this app. Before it was stable until the recent update makes it super hard to launch app and endless loop of loading time and slow app response. Been thinking to terminate BIMB just for this app is so slow and unresponsive most of the time and I mostly use online banking this is a troublesome for me. So, please fix this app you will lose alot of your customers because of this app alone
Useless... Annoying... Everytime when in urgent need to use this useless apps it will give u hard times. Really useless.
"Rooted device. Can't launch application" What does it means?
every time you want to use, there must be an issue, error traffic too high, or unable to connect to server, app crash end up use browser. The app is getting worse every time it is updated.
Lately I am having a problem with sharing any transaction via WhatsApp. Everytime any transaction, I always click the share button, sent via WhatsApp, transaction statement will be sent with pdf document. Now it fails when I click the share button. There is a statement stating pdf fails to be downloaded. Not sure whether it is my phone settings or the server
I think I saw MANY reviews saying how bad the app is. Especially AFTER pressing UPDATE. Initially it was fine, I like how it's user-friendly. However, the first problem I encounter is I cant use the QR scan by scanning code from gallery. I have to directly scan the code from my friend's phone, or from the shop's counter. THEN, the other day I cant open the app, so it asked me to update. BUT, AFTER UPDATE, it keep saying 'UNABLE TO CONNECT TO SERVER'. Excuse me? App developer? DO YOUR JOB!
This is my 2nd review. Lately the app has been useless. The app does not load. This began after receiving and update. Not sure what ya'll did to ruin the perfectly functioning app. Received an email to clear cache, but to no avail. The problem persists, Please do something.
Apparently, the buggy, hard to load app wasn't enough. Now they made new update to force you transaction by installing this app, supposedly to "make it more secure" yet doesn't even show the display number, making the progress even slower. I'm beyond annoyed. This will be especially an unnecessary burden for those whose in rush to pay things or in urgent
Server lambat gila tak habis2 nak login and loading page tu pun lama, its better if online banking xyah connect to this app, it only hinder the process if this keeps up
It keeps on crashing. Difficult to switch it on when i am in the needs to use it. But its ok since i can do the transcation by web. However, worse come to worse when we need to approve everything via the same apps that always hang. It takes forever for me to transcact a money. Please do something.
Everytime update, become much slower. Did u guys make improvement or decommissioning the apps? Every urgent thing make it slower demnn so hard.
I'm using this app okay so far, but I just want the developers to fix or improve one thing, which is the length of words can be written on "Recipient Reference" and "Other Payment Details" when transferring money. This problem is really putting me at disadvantages as I can only write a few words. I cannot detail any reason or statement to my payees. So, please fix this problem as soon as possible. Yes, I'm running on above Android 7.0, I'm on Android 11. I shouldn't be facing this problem.
This app is really useless. After key in all the id, password, ic & 6 digit tac number, it says "unable to process, please contact the bank. Not user friendly at all. Please don't waste your time to download it. Really useless and waste of time. Call the bank and they also have not resolved the issue instead ask me to use the normal website to login.
This bank app by far is the worst. PLEASE FIX YOUR APP !!! It is so inconvenient. Crashes all the time. And the interface is so not user friendly. Another thing, was asked to update the app then when i did it totally cannot worked stated that the server error.
Very slow and bad service make my payment time so long and loading so long long times. Better than uninstall this app
I dont usually complaint but this time, Im getting fed up with this app!!!!!!!! I can't even log in. I use Samsung S23U, so i dont think there is a problem with my phone nor my connection. I CAN NOT EVEN OPEN THE APPS. There are a series of events that people have to wait for me to figure out my banking apps coz i can not open it so I can not pay. Please fix it as it's getting worse!!!!!!! If there is 0 star, i would give 0
Hi, it's still happening. Since past few months, this buggy app still cannot open or login. Not only app, on website too. I had to use other bank account because of this. Note that: this is not due to poor internet connection. Other mobile banking apps works perfectly, only bank islam face problems. I already clear cache and still the same is happening. Not only me, other users i know are facing the same thing. 😌
To be honest, this new update on november is so disappointed. Can't even get into the app because of the stupid *server error* notification keep appearing. Its so annoying. Now, if I want to get access to online banking I need to go to the website. That's alot of step to go through. Also all verification that need the user approval through the go app seems impossible right now.
People should have the option to transfer money using the web interface and not be forced to download an app just to complete a transaction. It's stupid and tedious. Edit: Just realise I cannot check transaction history. Nothing comes up. Only details of money going out can be seen. No details on money coming in. Shortsighted design. Very idiotic.
Worse banking app ever. Not functioning at all. Can't even appear login page !! (Error 500)
Honestly, i would say this does not deserve a star. Why ? Because how could i rate it when it could not be used at all ? Just like the others, I faced the same issue. " Unable to Connect to Server" right after I installed the new version. The website ? Oh cmmon.. the system always down and it's very inconvenient. Please do something about it.
Bila update app latest, terus tak boleh buka,, loading je mmnjang..
I wanna say that please fix the bug and loading issues, whoever is incharge with this need to update their systems and always heavy on traffic. Took lots of time to just load a single screen, and it's a waste of time.
After installing the new app, it has been so hard to open in because it kept on stuck at the starting. Most of the time shows connection failure, server failed et cetera. So far this is the worst bank app I had ever installed or use.
I cant open after updating the apps..
This app always cannot open, stuck, slow , cannot connect to server. It's so terrible and sucks. Whoever is the developer of this app, please fix it ASAP! I only use this bank because I'm still a student. I will not recommended this app or bank islam to anyone. Their service was so bad. What's the point to update it just for it to turn into slower and worse so ever!
Please la Bank Islam..do something about your GO apps..you want to force people using it, so please make it better!!!!!! If people want to use it but it keeps loading FOREVER!!! And often cant be use becouse YOU EXPERIENCE HIGH AMOUNT OF USER?? JUST SHUT DOWN THE APPS IF YOU DONT HAVE MONEY TO INVEST FOR IT AND MAKE IT BETTER. JUST STICK TO THE WEBSITE. NOW YOU MAKE IT HARD FOR YOUR CUSTOMER TO DO ANY TRANSACTION!! THAT JUST SO STUPID. PLEASE DO SOME CHANGE!!
it was smooth before. however, since Nov 22, it gets into problem. most of the time cannot acess, stuck with the loading logo endlessly. i have emailed the Bank Islam contact center and replied that newer version is available. However, uninstalled and installed the new version, problem still persistent.
Annoying. Request authorize thru apps tapi apps asik problem je -_-
I've been waiting for a day to use the app and it's not working at all STUPIDDDD Can you guys make it better faster!
I have been with bank islam for close to 20 year and always had a pleasant experience. I never had issues with the app before but of late, with your new updates, the app is not opening, lagging at start up and it is irritating when i cannot perform online banking. I have to uninstall, install many times and yet still the same. Please do the needful and ensure your customer satisfaction is not compromised!
I can't login and then when I managed to login, it said system unavailable or error. The transaction takes too long and then it cancels it due to the errors or system unavailable. I tried using browser and then it asked me to confirmed in the GO app but then I CAN'T OPEN THE APP, EVEN WHEN I CAN OPEN IT, THE CONFIRMATION TOOK TOO LONG THAT THE TRANSACTION TIMED OUT. PLEASE IMPROVE OR YOU COULD JUST LET THE CUSTOMERS USE TAC NUMBER INSTEAD OF SECURE VERIFICATION. THANK YOU.
I'm gonna rate 1 star for now. I've been using this apps for years now and I've always loved it. But now i couldn't open the apps as it kept on saying "unable to connect to server". I've tried to reinstall again yet I still faced the same problem. Pls fix this asap!
Everything is actually great until a few weeks ago when i can't open the apps. No response at all. I tried refreshed my phone, closed all other apps I'm using buy nothing. I thought that i need to update the apps but checking the apps at google store, there's no new update. So I don't know what to do. I need to open browser to check my account. Now I need to update the apps. Let's see if I can open or not, the apps after updating it.
Last month I tried opening the app but it just wont open. Today, I tried again and am shocked to see that the app still wont launch. I'm not able to authorize any transaction and has to go to the bank. It's very frustrating and inconvenient.
Unable to conect to server issue. Tried clearing cache. Issue persist. Cleared apps data (without uninstalling) and login again. Issue solved. Although was prompted with 'invalid id' at first. Have a try. Not sure if the issue will come back. Developer pls fix this bug.
I think it's okay... but i really don't like it when they ask you to update & i've updated the app, i couldn't access the app later. Can really make ppl panic since everytime i tried to access the app, app couldn't get through the server. I had to uninstall the app & install it again. I really don't want to re-do it again everytime the app need to be updated. This need to be fix.
The apps is not functioning at all, there's nothing going on if I open the apps, just the pink cakground and that's it. Not even log in, the button for that is nowhere to be seen. Its been like that for weeks, but I still try to uninstall than install it back, still the same. Hope you cam improve the system.
Difficult to access. Loading for long time. Very irritating. If i could rate ZERO STAR, i would
Please improve the app. It takes a long time to open the app, and it takes even longer to make a simple transaction.
Bad. I want to transfer using online banking, has to download n login to apps to approve. When login to apps, its automatically logoff the online banking. And it's goes on an on. Want to transfer by apps, cannot. No account registered. Favourite account already exists in online, but not exists in apps and asked me to add in online. Why la? When tye loops going to end, i don't know and i don't care. Don't wanna use both anymore
Loading until time out. Other bank apps work well and fast, but GO BI apps, very disappointing.
This app does not entitled any star. Worst experienced ever. The website is much better than apps. Problems with go secure is that after you key in digits given, the transaction will not proceed. The app will log out and i had to log in again. So irritating.
Always does not work!. Sometimes it was like forever to wait this app from buffering.
Force us to use this broken app for duit now, never gonna fix anything broken on this app... the rating also so low and did not improve anything... What ur guys problem... Stuck on stone age, never gonna improve anything... Turning blind eye event many comments on this app are negative....
Your GO app is really unreliable. GoSecure frequently hangs, causing me to be unable to complete transactions. Frustrating! The app also takes a really long time to load (5 minutes wait and it is still loading!) Henceforth when I tried logging on on a desktop, the page declined saying I was logged on somewhere else! Bank Islam, your app developer really slacks. For a bank app to be this untrustworthy speaks volume about your institution. Do something right now before you lose more customers!
I cannot login no matter how many times I reinstall the app. It keeps on showing "Unable to process your request. Please try again." over and over. Update: Now on 7 January 2023. The problem still persists despite following the advice. Cleared the cache, uninstall and install the latest version, the same problem "Unable to process your request. Please try again." over and over.
Very frustrated with this app. Already installed and reinstalled many times over but to no avail. Stucked at good morning page. What irritates me more is the way the developer addressed this VERY IMPORTANT issue by just cutting & pasting the same answer all over again. Complainers have done the install/reinstall processes, gave access to location and even called the said support number but problem still persists.....PLEASE FIX THE PROBLEM ASAP and STOP replying nonsense!!!
very bad app. bank islam needs to do something with this problem. can't even load!! internet banking's suppose to make things easier for user, not harder.
Terrible apps. Cant login after many attempts. The message said done registering but the app keep loading. Clear all cache, restarting phone. But nothing work. Very annoying since online transaction through website also need this app to approve. Please ensure the apps would be better than previous version before launch new update. If cannot be better than previous, just stick at old version or using TAC number. Please do solve this problem as fast as possible!
The worsting apps I been used, the system soooo lag and for the first register I been sign up for half hour just bcz ur system is super lag n cannot recognizer user! Hence, when I use for transfer, the authorisation also lag. Very bad experience! If your apps n system is not mature pls don't launched the apps, just keep for using the website n IT department pls focus on how to gain website security! I even don't want to give a star.
Too long to enter. Too long to load. Cant do transaction. Worthless update.
The load takes forever... Is there anyone can fix this matter? Or would it stay like this forever?
Bad experienced and never try to fix their issue. Too slow to open it.
Worst app ever. The previous still can consider enven there is up and down. I have to instal & uninstall more than 10 times but still unable to open the app. Not sure if the app was created by whom. Might be primary school student I guess
Very bad experience since the last update. I can't open the app since a month though. I thought the developer will handle this professionally and efficiently, but it's just a dream I guess... They don't even bother the 1 star rate😌.. VERY BAD APPLICATION
Apps yg paling banyak masaalah. Tak pernah nak improve comment user. Shame to islamic bank app. Masaalah server lah aper bagai. Menyusahkan user. Lebih baik tukar islamic bank yg lain. Ayat 'WE ARE CONSTANTLY WORKING TO IMPROVE OUR SERVICE .....' give the big hope but the actual 'KELAUT' until now still got problem and nothing improvement done by service provider..... don't know when the problem can be resolved.
I'm always stuck at the loading screen, and it appears a few times when going back and forth throughout the apps, not when just starting it up. I can't do business when everything is slow and stuck.
You can enter the apps, everytime open it always shown problem with server. Then I open internet banking from website at laptop. Become worst, the transaction require approval from the Apps in the phone. What the hell??? How i want to transfer money, pay bills and so ever. Useless apps.
This system need to be improved. I think about change other bank because of this. A simple transaction become complicated. When need to pay or transfer to other account but need approved through app GO bank islam.. but it was lag too long.. This system should be friendly user like other banking app such as m2u and CIMB click. This system really bother when need urgent transaction.. Bank Islam need to learn from other banking like Maybank and CIMB how to improve your system.
Worst bank app. Can't even be open. The more it update the more I kept on getting server error message. You need to have NASA level computer in order to use this stupid app. And even then I can't guarantee you can actually open it. In fact, I don't even know if they even know what NASA computer is since how so dated and backward Bank lslam is. I haven't even started about their poor services and bad UI design. Can't even view my own card transaction histories.
Always keep loading, wasting a lot of time. Kindly improve on it.
Trash apps. Trash bank. Even online transaction need to verify trough apps very inconvenient and troublesome to use. I don't even want to say what's wrong with this apps. The developers doesn't event try to improve. Worse experience ever!!
After I update the app a week ago, this app has become useless. I even unistalled and installed it back. The problem still persist though. Cannot use it at all and everytime I tried to login there is always error message appeared saying " the app is currently experiencing a high volume of traffic ".. Really?
Always will have issue with it. And I can't see my balance. It will show unable to connect to server. Like everytime you wanna use the app it will have its issues which is so ridiculous. What is the developers doing with this amount of feedback aren't they supposed to come with and update???. So frustrating to use this app which is so useless.
Its worse apps. Always loading at the end cannot enter cause of error. Please upgrade apps.
It's very slow and shows a lot of error. I was trying to transfer money to my friend and the app logged out by itself. It's hard to pay with QR scan because I have to wait more than 5 minutes
Before the update last year, this apps was great... Then after the end of october 2022, i can't use it anymore after it updated into the new version... Everytime i try to key in my data, it shows up #400 Bad Request... I had call the customer service to fix it up but it remain same
Worst Bank-Apps ever. Took 2-3 days to log-in. Sometimes longer than that. Worst on payday. Have to uninstall, and then reinstall, so that can log-in. But the problem will repeat itself again and again. The bank never upgraded this app. Makes millions of profit, but apps macam sampah. Other banks never had this kind of problems.
Assalamualaikum, the app always crash whenever I open it. But after I update my phone operating system "Android OS", I finally get to use it properly, so far no problem for me. I finally can pay my flight tickets. Anyone reading this, I hope this is useful for you too. You should update your phone's OS before using this app. Or maybe update every single system app in your phone.
Getting worse now since the app updated few months ago. Keep getting stuck at starting page and ended with unable to connect to the server. Have been uninstalled and reinstalled hoping to be better but nothing improved. It is UNUSABLE and waste of time.
I love the apps. It's so convenient. The updates get better and better everytime. The best part is they provide you transaction receipt where in the website we need to screenshot. I hope you can add 'email' for refference too. Because normally online seller asked to put their email. Thank you and good work!
Too terrible experience, I want to make transaction and need GO apps to approve it. But, the apps mentioned "unable to process your request" and keep loading this statement. After re-install it, problem still can't solve. Now, I have to use another bank account. The apps is totally worse, why the technical team didn't settle the problem since it check the review here, already found many user have the same issues.
I'm having the same problem too. Fortunately after calling the Customer Service team, they advised me to uninstall the App and redownload again. It's work! Prior to that, need to make sure your Android version must be at least 9. Hope this helps for other users who facing the same prob.
I feel like i was forced to download this app when i want to make a transaction through website. And it's not so user friendly anyway. Lagi terkejut when i had to go website just to favorite an account baru boleh transfer thru the app. and i can't top up my phone bcs the button doesnt pop up after i've completed fill in everything! disappointed tapi terpaksa jugak guna.
always have issue while opening the app, please fix as soon as posible cause its the bank that i use to withdraw my money.
Lousiest Apps! Sorry to say this.! It's not the first but for so many times! Pls upgrade your system or else don't develop any apps, better!
Very baddd app so slow and keep loading , sometimes have an issue to login & makes me need to reinstall for so many timessss 😤 please improve this app ASAP
The app is the worst of its kind in the world. Under performing and keep on crashing. When I uninstalled it and installed it back, I couldn't log in and it deregister my device, meaning I'd not be able to receive any notification.
Always looping, never launching. Had to use browser to access my accounts. worse update ever.
Please fix the app. The apps always have problem. Cannot open the apps due to heavy traffic, cannot open qr at all. Please fix this, it's almost 5 months. I've been deleting and reinstalling this apps just to make sure the apps run smoothly. Please fix this
The fingerprint access is too slow, waited for the whole 2 minutes just to access my account, and it appears to be going on forever so I close the app. You might want to check your fingerprint access system.
Really disappointed with the overall performance by the apps or website. Super slow. I'm not sure whether it is worth it to give a star. ............ No improvement at all since my last comment on July this year. Still takes time to load before may enter the main page. Really spoil the "Islam" name.
I shouldn't gave any single star instead.Apps is keep on and on updating but seem like become more worse. Did cleared cache several times but it doesn't work. Really disappointed, BI Should alert and fix asap. Again I uninstalled and reinstalled.. Totally unable to open. What is happening...???😡😡😡 BETTER SHUT DOWN THIS BLOODY APP..👹👹👹
This system is so bad.. very2 lag and slow.. why there is no action from BIMB eventhough get bad rating?? NO IMPROVEMENT!
Before this using website very easy. Until using this app, my withdraw rejected multiple times. Wasting time. I hope bank Islam fix this issues.
The web is wayyyyy more better. Maybe should hire the right talent rather than recommendations to fix stuffs....pssstttt
THE APPS NOT ABLE TO CONNECT. SAME GOES TO ONLINE BANKING. ERROR --> YOUR ACCOUNT NUMBER NOT CORRECT (EVENTHOUGH THE NUMBER WAS CORRECT). TRANSACTION UNSUCCESSFUL.
Worst experience. Do something please, can't even open it properly. "Unable to connect to server" I tried every WiFi possible but still can't. Even though I rarely used Internet banking the app still not fixed from I don't know 6 month ago??? Imma need to change bank if this continues
Always server error eventhough i have update this app😩😩 what need i do ?!
Server error. I'm trying to change the limit that requires authentication from this app but the server error. I have updated & restarted my phone but still having the same issue. But after receiving replied from the developer on how to overcome the issue, the problem has been solved. Thank you.
Month before the app runs smoothly & superb,but all went downhill. Apps runs slow,needed few tries to get the App open,even restarting the phone,apps & clearing cache wont solve the problem! im currently using the latest update there was,no change at apps behavior.its unacceptable for good bank as yours.
Apps load too slow, last time when i was about to pay using qrcode at the cashier, i can order 1 more meal and eat and this apps still havent load.
After go through the register process, still cant open the apps although i received the message that told me the app have been successfully register.
The app was super slow. It's so inconvenience when we need to make payment as the app is super duper slow. Even if you get to login, the payment process was also slow. Please la do something. It's been months! Jangan sampai users tukar to bank lain sampai u guys have no money to roll for other purposes.
The app keep on saying "Bank Islam has stopped" when I try to open it. My phone still okay and got no problem with the other apps. I tried the clear cache method and it's still the same even reinstall it too. Either you're gonna fix it or use the old method by using OTP instead of telling us to use this app to complete the transfer for higher payment.
Too bad experience that i uad with this apps. Can't complete my online transaction because need to approve on app but your app not function well.
the apps is getting worse day by day. cant even log in because the server error. when will you guys fix your servers so that more users can use it at the same time????
Always the same problem, can't open the app
The worse app. Never work when I need to use it. I still need to log in to the website to do any transaction
I don't even know what the hell is going on with this app. It USED to work, now it takes ages to load to the login screen (and I have good data and home Internet speed). If you get pass login, going into other menus takes forever to load. I'd prefer to just TnG for cashless payment than DuitNOW because of how SLOW this app runs now.
Just wanted to let the devs know that the app was not able to connect to the BIMB server after the latest update. I tried updating, clearing cache, clearing storage and nothing works. It only worked again after reinstalling the app. I loved the app but it will be even more amazing if the GUI is more fluid, though that's just me being picky. Hopefully the next update is smooth as it's been a recurring issue. Kudos to the devs.
Please fix the app. Sometimes it takes time to load, unable to connect to server but when accessing internet banking through the browser works just fine. A few times I had to reinstall the app just to fix the server error. It annoys me because clearing cache doesn't help at all to reset the connection to server. Why is that a problem? Basically the app becomes completely useless when the error starts popping up, reinstalling is the only option. We use this almost daily now.
Previous version apps are more batter than current apps. After I updated to a new apps the apps seems having a bad issues. 1. It is hard to open, and it takes more time to open. Loading too long. 2. Even though1 managed to log in, when I choose, as an example, to transfer a money, the apps will be loaded again, and it takes a long time to load. 3. Not so friendly like before, because when I would like to check other things inside the apps, the same issue happens. Please make changes

I cannot even pay using online banking due to problem service.
NOT USER FRIENDLY AT ALL!!! Last review, 1 star on December 2022, until today Nov 2024, this apps does not improve much. They include fingerprint to make the access easier, but not easy at all. I can easily access to see ny account with 1 time using fingerprint eith other banking apps, but not with this app. To open each section, it loading for so long. To get approval for transaction also take some time. What's the point moving to 5G era, but your app still slow.
for the past week I couldn't get pass the starting screen of the app and thus i can never access the app anymore. i have checked if there's any update but there were none and my phone meets the app requirement system. the web browser works fine but it is frustrating bc i can't use the app anymore to do instant transfers. fix this issue please this is too absurd
Cannot launch the app. Tried everything and yet the login page never appear, stucked at the front page forever. Read the latest reviews, and the developer keep on telling to update to latest version (3.2.09), which is what everyone already have update to, or use phone with android 9 and above. No solution or whatsover. Very disappointed with how little they care about clients' experience.
The app is so slow, and it will not open at all. I have to uninstall the app and reinstall it every time i want to use the app. After reinstalling, I can only use it once. The second time I try to use it, the same thing happens, and I will have to uninstall again. After reinstalling the app, I can't make any transfers to other banks for the next 12 hours. I feel like closing my account just because of this. This app is not convenient at all. In fact, it is troublesome to the users.
Too many errors occuring from time to time Either not being able to log in, not able to use the QR, and even worse, not even able to open the apps even after waiting for quite some time. Had to uninstall then reinstall the app. It is annoying as you need to enter your data all over again
PLEASE DO SOMETHING TO THE APPS!! after installed the updated version, it is always loading and stuck at the start up n i cant open the apps. Update on 28 oct 2023, i believe there is no improvement that bank islam done to their apps, which is super non friendly user, lagging, need to open and log in several times, i almost forget my password because rarely use it due to the issues.

Useless app !  Most of the time take time to load unable to connect to server. It's really frustrating. I had to reinstall the app when I need to do the transaction. Annoying !!!
i will close my account because if this incompetent app. now that you force to use app to validate any transfer but it does not even connect. i have clear cache, update, uninstall and reinstall before you even try to ask for me to update this app. even tried with wifi and my mobile 5G speed. this is just pure garbage of an app.
25/8/23: Guess I'm not changing my opinion anytime soon. Very, very rarely it was fast. Rest of the time? So slow that I forgot I have to pay for something. Now? I can't even go to the main page, keeps telling me to reinitiate transaction. WT--?? Like I have no life to live, is it, to wait for the app to actually work?
the most stupidest banking app.. it will take forever to load. on top of that if you want to perform duitnow transfer through the browser, you still need to open your go app. it's so annoying and it really makes me angry. i have very stable internet connection. Hey bimb please learn from cimb how to operate an app.
Unable to connect the server? Already update the latest version (as of 7 October 2023). Already uninstall and install again to see if it's working, but still doesn't working. If we need to call the center, every user of this app will end up calling Bank Islam. The problem is this app itself.
Very disappointing experience using bank islam go, it takes forever just to get to the log in screen, not to mention the problem while scanning qr codes and many more.. what's the point of yall taking RM 13 from our bank accounts if you didn't do anything to fix the goddamn app..no one will be furious if there is a slight inconvenience for a short period of time, but this app has been giving people nothing but trouble for quite some time..please step up your IT teams
Why i kept getting error "400 bad request", although i already key in my correct password and id also the tac number. After that error, the app send me msg that i already registered yet unable to to log in. Please resolve this, i already uninstall and reinstall for several time.. Dear BIMB, Again this app really needs improvement. As from all customers that seems to have the same issues, we really need you to solves it fast for us to used it again.
Please please please do stg about the app start up, I can't open the app no matter how many times I tried, and since some transcation require verification from this app it's really frustrating! Why in the world does everything need verification from the app anyway, the duitnow I get, the jompay I get, but why funds transfer too????
Sometimes it's working.... sometimes NOT. It continues to buffer. So unfriendly users. In fact my phone is new, install & uninstall 3 times by now & updated the apps to the latest version. But still the SAME prob reoccurring. Fix you apps pls!
Too slow, the app keep loading and in the end, the session expired just like that. One more thing... it keeps telling us to UPDATE BUT NOTHING'S CHANGED!! STILL THE SAME PROBLEMS OCCUR WHILE USING THE APP!! Please make improvement on the app so that IT WILL BE EASIER FOR US, THE USER OF THE APP!!
Often to unistall and install. Also been waiting for the IAC to be send to my number take years. Requested for so many times still did not received any In case of emergency to do any transaction, this is very much troublesome. Transaction via website also need approval from GO Bimb. How to if I can't even open the apps ?
I will be honest. This app is the worst. The loading takes too long for me to open the app. If its only a minute or two is okay but it takes 5 mintues or even more just to load? I've heard the issue is not new which proves this app is just that bad.
I've already updated to the new version but still couldn't open the app.. I don't know why it cannot connect to the server. I've tried using both wifi and data but still can't open.
Very bad apps.. Always stuck and nothing happened after wait 10 minutes. Causing me very bad experience to transfer money using western Union and PFX with your apps. Very very very bad!!!!
the apps are so bad, clear cache, etc, still unable to open the apps. Online transactions through the website need approval through GO secure, but nothing can be approved since the apps only trying to load the entire time
Took super long to open the apps. Most of the time i gave up. Would rather transfer all my money to other banks, easier when i need to do duitnow payment at the store. Im super close to stop using this app.
I mean i understand that many people are using this app, but you have to accommodate good service to them. Make frequent maintenance, if u already did u have to make it even more frequent. Please people are just trying to get their transactions through and if u are wishing to keep them as customers, please improve.
Frequently got problem to share the transaction receipt. There are 2 ways to share receipt in GO apps .... thru (menu) history mobile transaction or thru individual account transaction history. Both got blank receipt. My phone OS is Android version 13. GO apps version 3.2.09.
The app was very very veryyyyyy slowwwwww!!!!!! Couldn't make any transactions with this app. I am beyond disappointed. Edit: after the recent update, there's no more slow loading so i think they deseve more star
i want to carry out fpx transaction. so i need to use go app to approve the transaction. and goes on loading till the last 120s of the transaction. and when i got at the login page press go secure to approve the transaction. it repeatly tell me the transaction has expired, when i still have 120s. i did a few more time with the same result till transaction have really expired. ok i give another go, i reinstall the app, reregistered it for 3 more time to do the fpx and it still waste my time
From bad to worse. It was already laggy and slow before. Since the update, takes close to forever to load(my internet is running at 500mbps) . And the interface is very buggy. I can't do any transactions just an endless loop of returning to the home screen. I end up using chrome or my PC for any online transactions. Please this app really needs a major update & revamp. At a time when most things are online you might loose more customers bcoz other app(bank) are better
If there is an option to give 0 star, damn sure I'd give it without hesitation. Every time updates coming this app has become much much worse than before. Please fix your app and your server so we can log in without issue. Fix the damn issue asap or else we will port to another bank.
Half an hour loading to open the apps. Very very very bad apps for such a big finance company. Please let us used the browser instead of this app.. I repeat.. Very.. Very....very very.. Bad and junk apps.
I hate this app ever.... From September until the end of October, this app can't perform well even i have updated it... I can't do anything to my money in the bank. Already made some reports via email and call centre for this issue. Seem like no action from them.
Not intuitive to use. I cancelled my transfer settings and press OK on the dialog option, nothing happened, not even to the homepage. I tap on back button and the app not responding at all. Can't even find ASNB account summary or related (not transaction) but the bank have that service, really not good. Edit: No error, I wrote "Nothing happened" means I got any feedback from that? No, you didn't code any error message. That's even worst.
Unable to login,Already clear and uninstall the app.Still get the same error. There is no more,Go secure for approve transaction purpose.It is very dangerous since no safety in online transaction. YES,this is the latest version of app.
Worst app ever exist! Very slow and u need to activate go secure even for small amount transfer. Waste of time!! Once lag, it's going to lag forever.. in the end, need to uninstall and install it again. No improvement despite people giving reviews. Don't bother to create an app if it's only cause trouble every time u need to use it!!
My rating for this app has plummeted significantly lately among financial apps that I've used. Worst experience and seems buggy, it hangs frequently and randomly unresponsive, not able to connect, etc. Not easy for online payment. Getting tired of all sorts of issue for a financial apps from a Bank. Really needs to buck up and hope security is no compromised though!
Greetings to whom it might concern. You are a bank institution. There supposedly should not be any crashes, trouble opening, and unable to connect to the server every time. Please do something about this. I am so tired of having to close and open the app every time I wanted to do transactions and approvals. Worst, re-installing for dozens of times. Thus, I had trouble making simple payments. I hope to actually use your banking app smoothly. I look foward to see some improvements.
I have no words for how much I hate this app. Recently updated, now my transfer limit can't be changed on the app. It's a different limit from the mobile site, and it's a ridiculously low limit that I can't do anything with. Uninstalling and reinstalling for the umpteenth time and hope (yet again) that this will fix the problem.
Im so proud of bank islam. Most of the time this app cannot work, always loading screen and server error. However, rather than solving this issue you guys have a great idea by making transactions approval using the go app. So if we successfully log into the portal using web browser, we still need to open the app which is 99% does not work. What a fantastic idea! Btw, stop using AI to reply all reviews. Clearing cache wil not solve anything for this garbage system
Please upgrade your apps. Tells me to update, after updating the app, it says cannot connect to the server. Need to uninstall and re-install. Tired of doing the same thing all over again...if i can give u zero star, i would. Worst banking app ever. I don't know how many times already i uninstall and reinstall your app. Don't tell me about phone spec, never encountered this problem on any other banking app. 😤
Worst ever online banking app I've ever experienced. After having to install, uninstall and reinstall, it still failed to function. Doesn't even deserve 1-star. Please buck up!! and emulate other banks' secure app that have been proven to perform, no need to reinvent the wheel, just get it sorted out before imposing on customers to use such app for our online banking transactions.
App not responsive to touch input on landing/login page. Uninstalled and reinstalled still unresponsive, cannot tap 'get started'. Hope can fix soon.
Actually not bad if you compare with other bank software. User friendly UI, Easy to use, just abit slow sometimes. Other all good for me.
After update, cannot connect to the server. Need to uninstall and install it again. Loading time too long when need to do secure pay, untill timeout. Not much improvement compare to other internet banking apps after a year from my last reviewed.
I can see this app is improving. My only complaint is that it would be nice if this app would let guest user login using the app that already has a registered user ID. Sometimes, I'm helping my mom doing online transactions when I was at hostel, so it was troublesome to deregistered my Go bank account just to use Go secure using my mom Go bank account.
the app just updated and now i can't even make it to the login screen because of "server error". it's a pain and i need to use the app for online and cashless transactions, do fix this problem ASAP
too many bugs,slow apps eventhough signal at the area in good condition, need to improve on the apps efficiency,unable to screenshot as a evidence while performing any transaction.
Slow loading apps. Very, very, very, slow loading apps. Not that user friendly. Always had trouble using this apps.
Asked me to update employment status when I tried to login through web browser but need to approve via app. Downloaded the app, but need to enable unnecessary permissions. When enabled, server connection error. Head father you, your mother green.
Loading too long. Sometimes not working. Been using for so long but the problem still the same. Never improve. Difficult when trying to pay with qr code cause need to wait for too long.
I tried to transfer money from using website, it refuses and ask me to use this app. But when I install the app and try to transfer, I keep getting error "You are not allowed to perform this monetary transaction for 12 hours".
At account details page, my money are still there but it keep decreasing at home pages. It's frustrating. I can't make transaction. It keeps saying i don't have balance left
Pure connection. Already update handphone to android 10, but still fail to connect, although after using variety of internet line.
Notice that there is improvement on the application, especially it is much faster than before, which makes QR payment is possible. Keep up the good work.
The newer version app has improved a lot. No more lagging. Easy to log in. Online transfer has been easy. A+ for team effort
Unable to login after newly installed in new phone. Keeps saying connection to server is lost. Please fix. Thank you.
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE fix your app sometimes it will suddenly became error and i need to reinstall it REINSTALL ITT !!! IT'S SO FRUSTRATING !!! BECAUSE I USED THIS APP FOR MY DAILY WHEN I REINSTALL IT AGAIN I NEED TO WAIT 24 HOURS TO DO THE TRANSACTION (24 HOURS 24 HOURS) YOU THINK I HAVE TIME TO WAITTTT. I already read someone chat and i read your reply . You said you already fixed it. But you lying the problem are still not fixed .
Edit Again: Alhamdulillah the app nowadays is usable enough. They get rid of the useless feature that caused the app unusable in the previous version
Now it's unusable. Keep giving me error code 500 (APZ_TSN_500). I did everything I could, reinstall, clear cache and data. Only work for a brief moment after I reinstall / clear data and it doesn't work after I close and try to open the app. For some reason, it works perfectly on my friends phone.
Every single time when I want to use go app , it crashed . Why can't you just like before ? Sending TAC through SMS , it's a lot more easier and after using GO app everything when really bad .
Hi again its me your customer. Recently I try to make a few purchases from tiktok shop but after the first purchase, the system started to go crazy and it can't even able to process my purchase anymore. It unfortunately cancelled out my promo payment hence why I'm rating it 1 star. Please kindly fix this issue.
lousy lousy lousy still..updated oct 2023 . Frustrating lately since up-dating this app recently, always unable to connect. Why give us this trouble now? after many years hassle free without un-install and install. Fix this!!! Nothing being done. Stop replying me the same stupid answer like the others.
I want to pay my uni fee, but I can't pay it through online because it's keep loading. I prefer, the old version where we just need to put code from SMS from need permission from aps. Because this app will stuck. I want to pay my uni fee!!!!
Sorry to say. Very bad and bad system ever. After update the latest one I cannot access my online banking. Always lagging all the time even though using wifi. Waste time waiting & drag my time also.
The apps took tooooo long to open since the update. It hinder all my transfer since it need go secure and the page won't open even the homepage. Please fix it asap
Worst bank app service ever. Low maintenance and really annoying to handle such simple tasks. Buffer all the time and not even a message to inform in the app have problems to be fixed.
Apps Loading time during peak and non peak hours are terrible. If other banks's apps can be efficient in terms of loading time and etc, bank islam should make initiatives to develop an app that is on par with other apps. Show some class 😮‍💨
Your notification was so bad. No information regarding the need to upgrade, uninstall and reinstall. Your sense of urgency is so bad that you not allow customer to perform transaction right after installing the app. Instead, you asked for a cooling off 12 hours? Are you running a beta version on BIMB customer? You made 12 hours of misery.
I cleared app cache and data. Tried again. Its working. Thank you. Just that the tag that comes in into the phone only works at the second attempt.. not the first.
Bad experience, and looks like no improvement even though customers rate low. I think you should test your apps thoroughly. It is still the same even you have upgraded the version. Please be serious on improving your customer experience.
I am using this app since last 3 years. This is so frustrating. The App doesn’t work when you need it the most. I think the developers of this App are too lazy to fix the issues. Going to switch to another bank this week. Bye bye Bank Islam.
cannot use during payday week, most of the time hang during transaction,go apps becomes not go apps..the 1st version way much better than current. What a dissapointed experienced!
Its getting worse..i hope you guys can fix this problem..its already a couple of days but i still can't login to the apps..i always update the apps..but it's doesn't seem to be a changes at all..
Truly disappointed! After so many attempt trying to login with password still invalid! We only able to login with same password and username thru website using chrome browser. Please do something with your crash app!
Very slow. Every day I will uninstall and reinstall back. Than need to wait another 12hrs for transfer. Poor app. Why keep continue such services. Very sorry. Very frustrating.
The worst experience ever in all history of Online Banking app. This app is super slow considering how every user's bank account need verification from this app and yet it took forever to load. Such disappointment
The previous version is much better than now. I can't even log in to do my transaction and there's always error that I getting annoyed now 😑. Please fix it quickly
The latest mandatory update is full of bugs. I can't open it well especially when I need to transfer my money. The previous version is way better.
Please make an improvement to your apps, I'm very frustrated and annoyed each time to make any payments because this apps keep take a long time on loading page before going to login page. Please Bank Islam, do better.
The apps is not workable, lagging and not able to log in all the times, resulting in broken dateline and promises( so not islamic at all). Pls pls do something or do we need to report to PMX as well. It has improved and i m satisfied now
After updating still no improvement. After one transaction succsess, next transaction always failed. Always need to log out and delete cache, then can do the transaction. Becoming worst every year.
Can't login, at first didn't approved access, then as it is compulsory, allowed the access, but get error "Unable to connect to the server" Off, clear cached, still can't get through
i can't log in Go By Bank Islam (it said Invalid Credential) eventhough i updated to the latest version and my device is not old version, i told to the email (contact centre) and no response at all, please fix it ASAP, i need to use the app
Just recently update the app, and now i can't even open it😑 it says can't connect to server. Edited: thank you Bank Islam. I follow ur instruction. I delete my app and install it again. It worked
One of the worst app that I ever downloaded. I used to pay via fpx online but after the new update, I need to get permission from this Go app and sometimes it doesn't even work and after the latest update I can't pay to purchase something online💆‍♂️
Very inconvenient. Unstable and non worked app. Cant even open the app and just keep loading. I want to give negative star for this useless thing. Rework this disappointing thing.
Cannot access Tabung Haji even with latest update. App condition somehow as if it's an app made by a guy who just build their first app. It's bank app so with current performance, it's a disappointment.
Told me to use the app instead of website. But the app cannot even open. So how can I transfer and stuff. So disappointed especially during emergency...
Why does it keep buffering? I'm unable to make any purchases. Help please Latest: I've already updated it. Still the same, is it need a very good internet connection?
Please I'm begging you please update and fix the system..its been down with server error for weeks and this is not the 1st time. Sometimes it takes hours just to load -whattt??
Hi there, what has happened to this app, I can't log in even i tried many time. Previous version has better version than this new version. Please improve this kind of problem.
Unusable. App will stay on the loading page endlessly. Its been going on for months! Update 02/10/2023: Latest updates makes it even worse. Did you guys hire a bunch monkeys to manage this app? Didn't gave them enough bananas?
apsal app ni slow sgt.. Bi kena lebih improve customer service n satisfaction ni.. 4 app yg lain semua jauh lbh lancar. Once account freezed, and it keep repeating wrong password.. and u have to wait for 12 hours to make a transaction, this is nonsense service.. I'll better move to other banks..
Worst mobile apps ever. It didn't work properly and not even able to open it most of the time especially for Android user.
The app some time not available as before . The loading process take a several times. Some time i got fed up with this app. Please make it smooth like your take it money from us.
for many times, i try and try but still cannot login and of course it happens during the most urgent period. worthless apps!
Previous update was better than current. Dont know if there any maintenance, app and web both take more time loading and lag when enter it. Please make good your system
The app almost always show error, saying gobank experiencing high volume traffic. Very hard to do online transaction which will need to use go secure.
Please upgrade you apps. Very slow. Unable to do transaction especially paying bill etc.. Thinking to migrade to other bank if no action taken to solve the problem
Struggle to access. I had reinstall for 5th time a day. It's very hard to access. Just used website. Please fix the problem. It's make us not happy with this latest version. Actually, time to time, this apps could be easy and friendly to use. Hopefully, please go through for this problem first. This is the major problem from the others. Thank you.
Developer's please improve more on your apps . Always being freak all the time . Waiting too long to log in . Please la find a better or more high intelligence IT artist for your apps like the other bank . Not make user easy but burden them .
4 Oct 2023: Everything goes smoothly for now. Still can improve the UI. Thank you to everyone involved. Up to 4 ⭐
I love the app although they have problem loading quite a lot. I use it mainly because i connect it to the tabung haji. But i cant do it anymore. Why is that?
Transfer all my money to bimb because i lost my Maybank card. Now i cannot do any online transaction due to this app keep on loading till kiamat. Damn very sucks. Why need approval from this app when your system very bad. Nak beli makanan pon cannot pay using qr pay
Seriously this apps is too slow!! I can't perform a simple money transaction due to the apps just loading itself and I waited for a whole 30 minutes just for the apps to open!!! Even tho it's like that it seems like there's no improvement from the developer to upgrade their application performance... seriously a horrible experience for a cashless person like me.
Very bad application. server always down. Error communication with server. Lag too long. Application did not have user-friendly. Any update did not change anything but make it worse. For technical issue, always be late and too long for maintenance. Suggestion: please improve your server, make staff trained very well for apps, do some testing apps before release it. If apps always crash, make sure ask opinions from another.
Srsly, this system must be improved. I am thinking bout changing my service bcs of this. A simple transaction bcome complicated as h*ll. Byk sgt maintanance. Yeah, a system should be frequently maintaned but the frequency of this app being maintance is just too much and sometimes so abrupt .it bother the urgent transaction. Not only that,the application has tons of problem. Slow.
The worst online banking app. It took so long to just open the app. It will just keep on loading I need to wait for a very long time for the app to literally open for me to do my payment. I need to open the app super early if I want to use the app. There's no nice experience for me while using this app. I really hope that your technology/it team could rework or do something to make the app run smoothly. People has been talking about this problem since forever and I can't see any improvements.
If the App fails, at least makes it relinquish hold of the account. Else, one can get stuck not being able to access an account from either web client or mobile, effectively locking one out of his/her own account! Update: Reliability gets worser with every update. Daily transaction limit has mistakenly being changed from the basis of accumulated amount transferred daily to just a single transaction per-day. Might as well just close your account if you rely on mobile banking at this point.
The apps really bad. You want to make every transaction need to be verified by GO. But almost everytime I do a transaction the verification not pop up from GO apps and the GO apps always can't be open due to high volume. It's really really bad!! Please improve your system!
Please upgrade the apps. Loading time to open the apps is unstable. Sometimes it's working fine, sometime it took forever. Making it hard to perform transaction. Especially, when using Go Secure. I am able to receive notification from other apps while the apps loading for Go Secure. I believed it is not my mobile network problem. Please fix the issue. Online banking apps should be seamless as we are practicing cashless transaction for the norm.
This has to be the worst apps for a bank. You cannot even access and the page rotates like drops of blood oozing and oozing. Even using the website, as payment has to be made, when it transfers to the apps, the apps does not respond promptly until you have delayed payment in your waiting list. Unfortunately, has to be cancelled and switch to another bank service. This has to be the worst nightmare for Bank Islam customers. I would rate this apps zero star for incompetence, slow & irresponsive.
Deserves no star. Time is of the essence when it comes to financial transactions, but with this app constantly crashing, it defeats the whole purpose of having an app for financial transaction. Don't introduce an app if it cannot serve it's purpose. What is the point of me having to approve online banking transaction on the go app if the go pp constantly crashes??? No transaction can go through? Just stick to the code being sent to your phone???
Dear admin, please fix your bugs in this app ASAP. The latest update makes everything worse. I can't even open the app, and I can't even transfer online banking at all. If the app isn't gonna get fixed, it's hard for the users to proceed online transaction. I've tried uninstalled the app and reinstall it back but still the same. So pls fix the bug as soon as possible.
Very annoying. It take a longer time to open the apps. After waiting for so long, the server down and unable to access it . Unhelpful and terrible services . Looks like i may have to uninstall it and change to another bank.
This current version apps are very bad than previous. After I updated to new apps, i having a lot problem to login to do transactions. Its take more times to open because it loading too long. Not so friendly like before. Please do something about that, otherwise you will lose so many customer later. Thank you
29th Jan 2022: GO apps keep loading for quite some time. I've updated my password and even try to reinstall it. But still the issue doesn't resolved. I've been calling customer service/support to identify what's the root cause. Can anyone from IT team able to solve it? 26th June 2023: It getting worse. Seriously it getting worse. Loading time, response time after key in password, transferring money as well (during OTP seems faster), now approving via Apps took a lot of time. Really frustrating
Very frequent system hang. Then I will have to uninstall and reinstall back. Pls improve system reliability and stability. Tq 23 June 2023 Still no improvement with the apps. I still have to uninstall and re install every single time I want to access the Go apps. Worse now it says I can only do transaction 12 hours after! 3rd time already. And you can guess when I try to login after 12 hrs, the apps will just flicker forever and I have to again uninstall and reinstall back. Pls revamp the app.
Actually the app don't deserve ay star at all, I can't even log in despite connected to wifi. The system always lagging and crash, even I'm trying to transfer to my own account. The latest instructions want to encourage the user to use GO apps for any transactions but sadly, the GO apps getting worst without trying.
The app has been working fine for a few weeks but now it suddenly keeps saying to the traffic is high, all the time. And i suddenly have a limit for interbank transfers which doesn't make sense. Just please hire a good team to sort out all these issues.
Worst app ever. Does not even start. And it's supposed to be an authticator!???? Please fix this. I cannot do important transactions because of this!!
It takes yearsss to load. I need to approve a transaction and it takes forever to open the apps. Please do something about this.
Very bad apps.. always crash, hang up, missing favorite acc setting, exceed tx limit error, etc etc 😩👎👎👎...prev version much better...I am frustated during every end of the month when you need to pay a lot of thing..but hopeless... I will terminate my bank account soon (fyi, i am acc holder since 1993)...bye bye
Took forever to launch and it is not user friendly. Admin needs to respond to this matter and find better solutions to improve customers' experiences. An app is supposed to make things easy, not the other way round. Worst service ever. I can't believe that the developer doesn't even bother to address the customers' feedbacks on the app/service performance
Loading more than 1 minute!!! Latest update but nothing changed. Still take a long time to open this app. If I need to do any online transaction😌 then need to get approval from this app, its really not help. I literally spend 2 hours sometimes just to make sure I can make online transaction. High traffic and loading whatsoever are not a joke when the online transfer time only 100+ seconds. Please do improve your apps. It supposedly secure and easy to use. Not just secure and unusefull.
The worst banking app ever. Took forever to login, always buffering. Cannot detect fingerprint and keep on error when logged in by password. Things get harder whenever I want to make urgent transaction. PLEASE do something about all this problems. It is inconvenience in so many ways
worst app ever. it took more than 5 hours to get the receipt of transaction. been loggin in and out. installing and uninstalling. still no improvement. please fix. should deserve no star at all. tired of complaining. same excuses all the time. how much time do you still need to fix this app? it takes forever for you to try to fix this thing is it? and still, no changes ???🤷🏻‍♀️
This app is a mess, cant do anything smoothly. Please improve your server. I cant access it 80% of the time. Even online transfer using computer is a hassle because the final authorization is through the app which you cant access most of the time.
I cannot even log in at all. I only have this bank and turns out its the worst. Someone needs to fix this app. The app said the IAC is sending me verification code but i didnt receive anything??? Whenever i wanna do online transaction and it asked me to confirm through GO as the final step, I CANNOT GET THROUGH. ITS SO FRUSTRATING. GETTING ON MY NERVES.
So technically cannot use anymore is it? I need to pay my college fee, and it requires confirmation from this app. How do i even do that, this app hasn't worked for almost a year
Slow and annoying...try to open the apps but it keeps on loading till hours, thus delay the validation process of a payment or transaction.
I can't use it everytime I try I just server error( unable to connect to the server) But other people can I already reinstall the app update my phone it still not working
Trash apps. If you want to force people to use apps for online payment, make sure it works in the first place. Crash, cannot login, taking ages to try 1 transaction. I hasn't managed to complete a single transaction since being forced to use the apps.
Not a good option if you want to use this apps as your main account. It takes forever to load for login. I have uninstall and reinstall again. Still the same problem. Better to have another account which has more user friendly mobile apps like MAE or CIMB. Today 20/9/23 still same problem. These comments mean nothing perhaps.
I usually use mobile browser to make transfer in Bank Islam. But now you put another filter as in to approve transaction in this GO app. It's good on paper, because another security authentication is always good, BUT THIS GO APP IS ALWAYS UNRESPONSIVE. Imagine a simple transfer takes nearly an hour just to be responsive. Shame on you. It's 2023 but this app likes like it was build in 90s. And NO! I will not reach you at the email given. Step up your game or you'll lose many more users like me.
I recently used the Bank Islam Apps, and it left me thoroughly disappointed. The app's slow performance led to frustrating delays, leaving me waiting embarrassingly outside a restaurant. Adding to the frustration, I was informed that I had to wait a staggering 12 hours before I could make a much-needed money transfer. It was an emergency, and the app failed to provide a timely solution. In desperation, I resorted to using the website, which thankfully worked fine
The system experiences delays until it times out, in Islam is sinful to kill people , this app leads people die fast due to stressful using the app. Therefore, it's essential to invest more in bandwidth. Additionally, there was a security flaw in Duitnow that allowed a hacker to empty my account yesterday
Getting worst, cannot open. Please fix it asap. Cannot transfer or doing anything online. Bodoh punya apps. Still same problem after update. Stupid. Ur apps terrible
After update new version, cannot log in..loading too long..waste my time to do any transactions..so disappointed. Please fix this problems.
I've had quite a frustrating experience with this app. Picture this: you're in the process of confirming a purchase, and you're given just one minute to do so. However, the app takes an eternity to load, and when the time finally runs out, all the items in your cart disappear, forcing you to start the search all over again. It's a situation that leaves me truly disappointed, and I believe Bank Islam should take this feedback seriously. What a shame.
Very slow and unresponsive when selecting several features within the app. Looking forward for improvements in the near future. I expect it to be as good as CIMB clicks app
Mandatory but annoying whenever we need it the most. It lags during online transactions and multiple attempts at reinstalling often leads to confusion. The old ways were pretty much better.
Technology is getting more sophisticated. But this application is still outdated. Please.. Make the maybank2u example always up to date
Such a stressful life using this app. Always problem to log in, very slow server, and even I had uninstall and re-install this app almost 10 times. Sometime this app recommend to use internet banking if this app was in high traffic, but same thing happened. Is hard for me almost all the times whenever I want to pay for ptptn, bill, online payment just because of this app. Overall, this app very not helpful at all. Is makes me stress out even more.
If u want us to update for a better version, make sure that this application is not slow and always loading, I'm tired with this apps, newer but slower version, so what the point of updating if all this things the user need to exprience? Please keep maintaining your apps for better version, fix it asap!
Current version not user friendly. Always have an issue when try to log in and take time to load. The apps keep down whenever we try to open. Please help to fix this. Very difficult for a user to use the apps.
Simple, yet full of features. Unfortunately, not 5-star as it's sometimes difficult to access.
I would give 0.5 star only If I can. This app so worse and complicated to use. It's very sensitive about the security maybe and always got some problem, trouble, issue etc and ask us to go to bank, email the bank or call bank to fix it. Other bank is better because it's easy to use unlike this app. Always give us problem even though we use it politely
The previous version is much better than the latest one. The apps even cannot open anymore. Always lag and not responding. I even can't log in the account. This is upset cause i cant make any online transaction and check the bank account details.
Please fix and do something. I don't know what happened here. Every time I use this app, it shows the 'server error' on the screen 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
Unable to open the app. The app keeps loading for 5mins+. Cannot do any online transaction within the app.
When using scan qr function, there is no dot (.) when you want to make payment. So can't make payment if cents is involved.
If its possible, no star at all. Downloaded the apps because cannot continue with the transaction using the website, then the server keep on "unable to connect to server". U want people to use your apps, like PBe MAE, but then the apps is not working. How come? Many people comment already, no action taken meh? Very poor. Better no apps. Just back to the kampung style. Sigh
WORST APP EVER. Taking forever to load. If you still want to use 'ISLAM' as a brand, kindly improve the app to be more efficient and reliable. It is very embarrassing to see 'ISLAM' attached to a poor, terrible, and pathetic app.
Got an update, cant log in,.. reinstalling and after all registering it ask me to wait 12 hour, and when i do i still cant load the log in screen.. The biggest dissapoitment ever.
please do something bank in should be more easier. I tried to open this application for almost one day. it can be open.. can be impatient. It takes too long to open. Too many time to install unistall. On off the phone.. high traffic it's can't be related. Urgent transaction make a worse experience.
your team have make an improvement to the apps, much better and faster,please make it better. good job.
Edited as 28/11/22 : Only can login after new installation, and the same error still occur on the second,third,4th login you name it. APN_TSN_500 please fix that, or you guys seems working on new app ? Wanna to abandon this one really bad arent you? Edited as 7/8/23 : After a years away, decide to try the app back, now i can say its much better and no pop up error no more. But you are a big name companies, problem like this shouldnt take 1 years to be fixed. Change my ratings to 5 stars
After the update, now the application can be open smoothly without any stuttering or loading problem. Thank you developer!
This app request to update new version to open it but only load for so long and can't even open the app. So bad!!
Really bad comparing to last time. Before upgrading the security, using the TAC is just fine because I can proceed with my PC. But now it requires SecureLogin and then the app is lagging as hell + unable to load. What a waste of time
This is why I hate every single of Malaysia Apps, one of it because, too slow, yeah loading too slow, even sometime the app crash or error. How do you even create this app like a crxp? I want transfer or pay and sometimes the app have a problem, please improve your apps, you want a better rating, improve.. Not just replying and said tq for support and any problem pls report blah blah blah.. No, we don't wanna hear that, we just only want you to improve, that's it
One of the worst app ever. Why? Because you cant even open the app. They dont give you TAC number anymore to your mobile. You need to approve it from the app when you want to make the transaction. But how do i approve it if i CANT EVEN OPEN THE APP??? The worst app ever!!
The old version allowed me to make loan payment even it is joint account unlike this version. Need to make payment via web..so much trouble just to pay my housing loan. This new version also does not allow to take screenshot which I think will be much help to me when I make complaint (as attachment). Useless !
I have poor network condition in my area. When i wanna topup using mydigi. Then for the next step to approve transaction , i need to open apps to approve it. During the approval, the app cannot load due to poor network. After that incident, i cant open the apps because it always popup the approval for transaction then always popup error. What do i have to do to make the apps working properly? I have reinstalling the app but the issue is not yet solved.
Worst app ever. Entered the correct login details yet was blocked. To make it worse I cant even reset my password. It keep looping either at the same page or saying cant connect to server. Seriously, the worst app I have ever used. DO NOT INSTALL!!
It took too long to log in after latest update😠😠😠 After update to latest version,still it takes too long to log in even my phone is already operating in version 13
Dont know what is the problem always exceed limit when i want to make a transfer . Worst apps ever. Better dont have to use app.
Very bad, slow and the apps doesn't even open. Dah la urgent nak bayar student fee, apps pulak lambat tak boleh buka. Even dh uninstall and reinstall balik apps pun still tak boleh buka juga. Please fix the apps
Why it always pop out"can't connect to server" it always happens.it wasn't my connection it all about this app. Please fix em'. So annoying me.
So many issues with the apps. Need to install and uninstall so many times. Least favourite banking app.
Hi. Sorry for the review. Actually it is my mistake. After reading carefully, there are two type of app, 1 is GO, another 1 is GO BIZ. I install the GO BIZ and wondering why I cannot login. Turns out it is actually for business account, which I dont have. Then I install the correct one, which is GO, and I can login now and everything working fine. So I edit back my review and give the app 5 star as I'm very satisfied with the app sp far. Sorry again for the confusion.
just shut down the app if you guys can't handle it 🤷🏻 buat app simple simple sudahlah Fix your stupid app, the app always buffers when entering ALL THE TIME I HAVE TO WASTE MY TIME WAITING FOR THIS APP TO OPEN
Not really work during peak hours. As banking application, it should be able to support higher traffic especially during peak hours. It will be good if IT team can improve the apps ability to handle traffic
ISSUES ALL THE TIME, DELAYED IN OPENING THE APP. which is a huge problem when i wanted to make any transactions in store. Will move to other banks after this. Really bad service. Came back to edit my review, still bad. Much worse. I cant look at my transaction history, have to reload many times. When i say many, more than 10times. So yeah, I don't use the app anymore. I transfer all my salary from bank islam to my other bank straightway after receiving them 😤🤌
As usual this apps are never fail to disappoint me. I want to open it but its just freeze. I cannot log in it. The only successsful thing for this unreliable apps just to frust the users with its uses. Even before log in. The this apps is freeze. So as a compliment i congratulate the developers for developing this incompetent apps for the users.
This app can't working since a few months ago. I have try all methods that have been taught, but the problem is still remain unchanged. I'm using Redmi Note 9s which still Android Version 10. So I hope that this issue will be solve as soon as possible. Thank you.
If you all have issues with unable to connect the server, try uninstall and install it. Hope it helps!
i agree with everyone here. Worst app, slow, and hard to make transaction. stop replying with "we're sorry" and start making improvement. for the meanwhile let us just use the web and TAC instead like before. much easier. you want to make it more secure but the main problem is your apps are getting worst and worst. pleasela fix.
Please improve your service bank islam. This apps should be usefull for everyone cause nowadays everything can be manage by using phone. You're one of the best bank i think that i have use but your apps oh god please improve this! Do something!
Very useless and non-reliable application. Always stuck at the starting page. Have to install and reinstall to make it work, then after some time it will fail again. I don't know who Bank Islam appointed as the developer, including their IT team but they definately non competent and failed big time.
Worse ! Very frustrating! When I need to pay for online shopping, it needs to be authorised on the Go Bank Islam app. When I open the app, it takes a long time to load. After I enter the number and do it, even after the screen shows done, it doesn't pay for the items I need at the online shopping apps. Please improve these. When I deactivate my Go Secure and pay for my online shopping, it still wants to be authorised by the Go Bank Islam app. So, please improve this also. Thank you.
Alhamdulillah... GO by Bank Islam has gotten better since its downside recently and provided an improved online app banking experience for its users. It is functioning better than ever. Thank you very much Bank Islam!
The app keeps on loading in the front page, can't even log in. Very inconvenient. Needs to uninstall and install it back for thousand times cuz it keeps on crashing. Very not recommended when needed to use it in rush.
Why is it taking longer and longer to load the apps??? 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ Developer of this apps should fix it. It's inconvenient. Everytime I want to pay QR, I have to wait for hours. Most of the times I have to say sorry to the cashier and I have to waste my car's oil to go to the bank!!! What's the use of online banking if it is unusable???!!!!
Forever causing difficulties when needed. Forever high traffic, forever cannot procees, forever cannot read finger print & forever making me like a fool when need to pay or transfer at counters or shops. When call for report, the only answer u guys can give is still in the process of developing to give better experience. Nowadays, never have i ever had the experience of logging in only once to just to complete an easy task such as checking my balance. Must at least 3-6 tries before successfull
I am getting error unable to connect to server since the latest update. Such issue shouldn't happened for a banking app.
first time using this application, it went smoothly but the next log in, this app asks me to register again, but when I want to register, this app always can't perform, the answer is always given,"400 bad request","unable to connect the server"," high traffic","server error"...this app does not cooperate and cannot be used because it always asks to be registered...this app is not work ￼
Hi, please make the app very convenient because it really not helpful at all. To transfer or make a transaction, the loading are to long like there are no connection. The website version more convenient & fast than this app, even you successful to log in doesn't mean you transaction will make it on time. Don't link the web transaction confirmation to the app right now. Please bank islam I've being your customer since in college & now I'm 30 don't make it useless make it smooth & fast
The app is slow because it needs a strong Internet connection. That's all. Suggestion: 1. Update the UI app to more fresh one following the trend right now (Be U can, why the official app cannot right?) 2. Make a more friendly user UI, not old school one, bold & not interesting UI.
I don't understand why the app is getting worse after each updates. Online transaction can only be done/approve after approving it via app but app keeps on crashing and it said 'need to reinitiate new transaction'. When new transaction was initiate,the same thing occur again. Then it said new transaction can only be done after 12 hours. Kindly improve the app and fixed the bugs as I never encounter this issues with other bank's app.
Please make this app going faster and smoothly. It took me 10 minutes just for entering. Sometimes server busy and not responding ☺️. It is better using official website then the app. Feel too much irritated due to loading. Even after loading some of the transaction is late updated. And sometimes the available balance and current balance is not merge amount making me confused.
the system always slow went i want to used it to pay anything with qr and it keep say no connection but my line or connection are in good condition.
you gotta be kidding me- i've been using bank islam for a while now and tell me, why is there server error keeps happening every time despite i was having a really good internet connection, especially if i want to make IMPORTANT transaction????? i wish i can give zero stars for this app because it gets progressively worse over time and i see no improvements AT ALL for the past few years since i opened the account
Why the apps always out of server? It's kinda annoying when it happen! It's prevent from doing transaction! I hope you can fix it as soon as possible. It's always the connection problem. Why? Hope this will be fix!!!
Apps stuck hang! App still having the same problem. Loading to long, tried uninstall and installed back still facing the same problem year ago today still facing the same problem. What does this company do for improvement actually. Other banks already making it easier for customers but this company still no changes. Shame carrying up big name for bank name.
Very frustrating. Update, uninstall, reinstall, clear cache a few times still not working. Shud change to other bank now
Literally one of the worst banking app to ever exist. Don't even bother downloading. I'm on the latest update and the app seems to be stuck on that annoying "loading" screen whilst I'm on an important affair. It's 2023 and the app still has major performance issue. Not to mention the horrible UI design. Bank Islam needs to fire whoever is in-charge on maintaining this app.
SO SLOW THAT I CANNOT GET ANY PAYMENT DONE WITHIN TIME LIMIT. since they don't give TAC anymore, i have to approve payment through the go app but it takes forever to load the screen. one time i got a 20 minutes time limit to finish a payment. the whole 20 minutes. THE WHOLE 20 MINUTES. THE SCREEN WAS STILL LOADING. PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS IT MAY HAVE DISRUPTED SO MANY OF YOUR USERS' BUSINESS.
The most useless apps in the phone.not a friendly user apps since it's take too much time to open it (always shows high traffic volume while the user's internet connection are good..better upgrade your apps as soon as possible.
What the hell with your apps, it's getting worse day by day, i don't know what type of system that u've been used, it's seem so bad and always not function., Do something with your system, take a look and try at least to improve your system, i thought with apps more easy, but end up it's make me more miserable then before, you guys have to do something about that, try follow like maybank2u, more easy and friendly user..
STUPID APP!!!!!!! everytime server error, loading take a very long time. how to make online transactions if you cannot even go into the first page. it should be name as NO/CANNOT GO APP instead..better changing to other bank.
Please do something with this app. Transection cannot go smoothly. How many time have to uninstall and install back.
Please fix the loading issues on this app, I am restarting this app for 10 times and I still couldn't get through.
Frustrated. Almost every time i want to use the system always down. Please improve it.
Can I know why I use Celcom data(I don't test others brand data) cannot use Go Bank Islam? When I try using wifi, the app smoothly open which have no needed pending a very long time. I try watch yt on 1080p using a data, the speed is okey no slow. Please fix this horrible situation because I was on the hurry to use Go BI but can't open it. If something emergency I cannot rely much on this Go Bi. Other than that, please make bank islam look more user-friendly because it's hard to use.
Almost every time need to delete the app and relogin to access to the app. Pls fix the login problem.
I want to open the app, it takes a long time to load..then I want to transfer money, it loads again..then it is denied.. after that i must to delete the app, then download it again.. open the app, it loads again, then it is denied and I have to wait 12 hours to make the transfer.. the same thing happens over and over again.. please do something & improve your services..
Please USE MAYBANK M2U programmer to make this app better. Really hard to open, even to check my balance. When i want to make transfer, app showing error, but money already transferred. Very frustrated. This is about security & people money. Please making big change for ur banking system. Dont just keeps updating without any different. 0 star to u guys
The new online transaction where it requires this "very well made app" is such a great idea from them as I would need to face the buffering, 200 seconds when there's problem with the app, error 500, reinitiate the transaction and much more :). I had such a blast using this app!!!!:)))))))
Worst app ever. It is supposed to make things easier, but this app makes things harder. Always took a very longggggg time to launch, always high volume of traffic. Wasting so much time waiting this app to launch to make a single transaction.
It says wrong server, wrong connection then I uninstall & install the app again it become worse.. App keep loading.. Please do something..
Please fix this app ASAP, i've been uninstalling and installing this app countless time, everytime wanna use it, I can't even open it. It just keep on loading and doesn't let me ues it. Not only me, some of my friends and family face the same problem.
The most ridiculous bank app I've ever had to use. The thing just keeps loading for eternity on the welcome page! I can't even do online banking with my Bank Islam account because of this! WTH
TAKES TOO LONG TO LOAD. Please take action and fix this app. Making it difficult for users to pay and check the balance. It seems that not once or two users sound about this problem,but your party still does not make reforms and improve the problems faced by all of us.
THE WORST BANKING APPS EVER. This apps doesnt deserve any star at all. Very slow response. This problem has been addressed for so many times but it seems like there are no initiatives at all from the developers. If you dont want to improve your apps then dont bother create one. Will definitely switch to another bank
Need to get started after update. But after key in IAC number, it's loading until forever. Do it 3times but still same, even already received sms said done register go apps. Buying new phone to make sure using latest android version. Still same. Usually open in website. But right now want to have approval in go-secure. So, cannot do any transactions.
What is wrong with this app?! Its getting worse than the older version this is so time consuming. It keeps loading way longer than expected. I cant do my online transaction if this keep going on. Do something about this IT management or whoever in charge for this apps. Because this app is so disappointing.
Before the latest update i like this apps , smooth but after the update can't open the apps ' LOADINGGGGGGGGGGGGGĜGGGGGGGGGGG......plis fix this prob ASAP....TQ THE WORST BANK APPS SYSTEM I'VE EVER SEEN COMPARE TO OTHERS BANK APPS....
This app sucks, before this doesn't have any issue. Now after new updates i can't use it like before. The apps always crash, cannot log in, and now when doing transaction we need to use go secure and it need the apps to works in order to proceed but now the apps it self cannot open, then how i going to proceed with the payment?
Please disable the function which require customers to use this app for making transaction online, it cannot be use at all, especially when there is urgent need to transfer money. People may die somewhere because of this useless apps! I will consider to terminate my bank account if the issue still continue.
Very slow, difficult to open, please upgrade your service like other banks. Now I cant log in due to unable server🤬
App is so slow. Always have problem / Time Out while waiting for GoSecure to authorize fund transfer..
Bad. Everytime also cannot open. Always high volume. I need to uninstall and reinstall. Still cannot open. Lame. Now fully need to use gosecure what so ever, but to open, the apps still loading.
Previous is much better than new version or even worst.I could not do transfer after skip one time and pop up said it can be done after 12hr ??? What??? Bank islam please dont do this , you should be better with growing IT...
I think this is the 10th million times I had to uninstall and reinstall. Almost a year has passed and this still could not be resolved? It was such a nuisance when u have to do an urgent transfer but the gosecure couldn't be accessed as it took forever to load the page!!! Apa ni bank islam? Benda basic masih lagi sangkut?
worst app ever. so slow. always loading. it deserve 0 star. this problem has been happening or so long, was wondering if you ever want to improve this app?
Honestly I have no idea why I even bother still having the app, it is an effort in futility with how slow and the incomprehensible waiting time for it to open. It just like their management just want to be cursed by their users.
Very disappointed with the app. I don't know why I thought having all my money in this account would be useful. I've been trying to order my food online, and I couldn't do it as this app is not even turning on. I can't transfer in even from browsers. Haritu rasa macam dah okay sikit masalah ni, tetiba jadi balik. Tolonglaa be responsible with the app. It freaking holds our money, how should I believe this app if nak log in pon dah macam2 problem. Very embarrassing.
getting worse after the update. even a standard online banking would FORCE its user to open GoApp to authorise EVERY EFING transaction. This certainly causes unnecessary problem since I am the one who manage my family bank acc just from online transaction, totally away from home as a student. It it much easier before, but now, cannot anymore.
The app is worst! Only few times I can use my online banking without any problem, most of the time the server just doesn't seem to work. Nonsense! Please do something about this or else, do not have any apps at all.
I have updated the apps, but it is getting worse. I want to transfer to shopee, but fpx Bank Islam can't be used. Shopee history already stated as cancelled, but in the Bank Islam apps, the transfer is still reinitiated. After that, I can't open the apps because I keep mentioning "reinitiated transfer". Even after uninstall and install again, it still the same and can't be used.
this is the worst online banking app ever. It is always unusable. always under repair & log in takes a long time. I don't know what the problem is. every time I want to use it, I have to uninstall and reinstall it. please fix it. I can't stand it anymore.
It is good enough now. But still sometimes it will be stuck on the loading screen. Hope it can be better soon.
EDITED 25/6/23 : i thought it was getting better. Sadly, the smooth experience only last for 1 week. Now the apps is getting worst and slower than last time. Im planning on changing banking apps. 3 years and still no improvement. Please change your dev team / invest more on user exp.
Really bad experience. Too many times unresponsive, taking a lot of time loading and just now i can't even pay my bills because it has to be approved by unresponsive apps! You need to learn from Maybank or even MBSB, their apps are much better.
It don't work for open the apps n transaction. Please repair your apps!!! Why not allow to click apps this, aq geramm til lah baiki boleh tak?!
Good job, the application is better day by day. Keep improving, hope it'll be as good as it could be.
Already updated,but still have problem. cannot make a payment or transaction by using other apps
Selepas updated makin teruk loading dan over slow. Kenapa system apps bank islam menyusahkan pengguna? New prob APZ_TSN_500 unable to process your request. Still same when to open apps.
This app has been abysmally slow for the past months. It always fail to load past the circling loading animation. Not to mention my uni where i study use bank islam as main channel for financial services. But fortunately my uni has change to new RHB Bank. Please devs, fix your app ASAP. Update to dev : cache clear didnt help. I almost lose money when buying bus ticket using online banking bank islam. I was forced to use the app's Go Secure function yet the app fail to load past circle animation.
Previous version apps are more batter than current apps. After I updated to a new apps the apps seems having a bad issues. 1. It is hard to open, and it takes more time to open. Loading too long. 2. Even though1 managed to log in, when I choose, as an example, to transfer a money, the apps will be loaded again, and it takes a long time to load. 3. Not so friendly like before, because when I would like to check other things inside the apps, the same issue happens. Please make changes
It's faster than other bank's app that I've used. For now. BUT... I can't share the receipt nor can I screenshot them. When I clicked the share button, it's loading forever. It's troublesome.
It doesnt work lately. Infinite load screen, terrible lag. Its a shame becuz i really like the interface. Please keep performance in mind. Your web app works flawlessly, why the mobile app so bad?
The authorization thru the Go apps is really annoying, I only want to spend like rm20 thru fpx but I still need to authorize my transaction using the apps. I understand it will increase the security . But if the apps keep loading forever how can I even buy things online. I need to buy some food for my CAT!! AND THE APP KEEP LOADING FOREVER...MY CAT ARE DYING. WHY ARE YOU MAKING THIS HARDER FOR US 😭😭😭
This app keep getting worse every time I update. The "loading" getting longer whether still log in page or when I want to transfer. PLEASE FIX THIS. Supposedly when it updated, it getting better not otherwise.
I try to reinstall the app because its still in the loop mode for a long time. But after reinstall Ive to wait 12 hour to do duit now transfer. Instead trying to make it easier for us to do online transaction, it make we are keep waiting and harder to do online transaction. Such a nuisance!
Terrible app. Even ady update to version 3.2.10, even ady reinstall many times still cannot use the app.
The new update is really bad. If You want to transfer money, the app needed you to reconfirm in GO app, GO app took forever to load, in the meantime you have 180 seconds to confirm transaction through GO app thats still fail to load. I am really Disappointed. The worst experience ever.
Several problem occurred after recent update. Can't pay anything that need approval from apps and can't open the qr code
Slow connection. Unstable apps. Please improve for better performance. We are going for digital platform so need a better performance and easier for use.
Can not log in in the phone app. Keep loading. Very disappointed!!!!!!!
Poor services. Can't access apps due to high traffic, so need to use browser instead for transactions. Better use browsing rather than download this apps. Kindly test run the apps stability then only launch it.
I can't connect with this app. That's weird after updated. And always wanted update. Weirdo

very bad after update..everytime and everyday when i'm want to log in... still cannot log in and still everytime traffic issues..it's make me stress.. i like to throw my phone in the river everytime i log in this apps.... very2 stress... every time and everyday its very2 hard to log in... when it's really impportant to use.. but still cannot log in.. very bad apps right now. . after reinstall.. it's still cannot log in.. every minute traffic issue...its not good to use right now.. i hate this..
used to make online transfer from website but now it needs to get approve using the app but the apps is sooo slow. this is why I prefer using website rather than the apps. please fix it, I've been waiting for days and still to transfer my money from bank islam to another bank. don't make people's life hard, it's not good. so many complaints but nothing change.
Issues all the time, you will either face "unable to connect to server" or "high traffic" notice. Even though I have updated to the latest version and even reinstall the apps a few times, there's still no improvement whatsoever. Nonsensical. Update: if the app is only problematic for me, I may understand that I need to clear the cache or change to mobile data. But, when all the user are facing the same problem, it just shows that you have failed to provide a bare minimum for this app.

App becoming worst after the last update rolled out. Seriously slow, lagging, take long time for loading more than a minute, need to clear cache many times just to approve a transaction or get to login interface, and forever loading. Honest talk here, please do improve the apps. thank you
Very bad Apps. After updated, long long time for the loading. Please improve you Apps
Too bad.. took a veeerrrryyyy long time to access lots of hang, hard to trsfr. Bad apps.. need to improve more
Very unreliable apps , very hard to do transaction , i had to transfer all my money to other banks for better transaction procesess
the worst app ever. if your system cannot support the go secure feature, then better delete it. Just use the old tac method. Really wasting my time using this app. Need to go forth between this app and merchant app many time because the transaction cannot pass thru after the go secure step
It took so long to just open the app, keep loading, then after key in the password, need to wait again. Imagine if I use online banking payment, got long que in market, sure I'll get yell from other customers behind me. This is so slow. Bad experience. Needs to improve or I need to open new account bank and choose another bank instead (of course not Bank Islam no more)
I'm just give a single star because the process is too slow. And my money getting lost by itself without I use it. I'm not rich to sacrifice my single cents
Why keep saying to clear cache. How many times clear (lost counted) it still lagging and there's so many comments with same problem . Slow , lagging ,system down & bla.. bla..bla. Don't just respond to customers to convince them only, pls also solve the problem and find solution . Previously this apps not that worst .
can't open after updated the app,updated to the latest version (3 October 2023) still cannot open,android 12
Very slow for every loading pages, I wait for 5 minutes also nothing happen, please take this seriouly.
We know u trying your best to keep our fund save, but please if u guys always hold and updating the app for unreasonably period of time during peak weekends. It's no absolutely contengency plan from your side on how we need to dug our money for payment... Duhh... Maybe all BIMB branch is super high volume right now withdraw thier money manual for each payment.. if u guys not an expert in apps try hired some expert to do it right! It just took obvious.. too obvious... Same things always happen..
Response is slow as hell. While waiting for the loadings that appear everywhere in the app, I drove to Bank Islam (which is 30 minutes from my home) and performed the transaction. When I got home, it was still loading. Bravo to the developer.
Took lots time to make transaction. Sometimes failed to do it. Just loading...
"02-0005 INVALID CREDENTIAL"....I was locked out of my own account because the app always saying my credential is invalid even though it was fine when logged in via web. 🤬 Installed because the website forces to approve transaction via app, but the app says invalid credential. There should be a 'no' option because I hate the app. This app has major issue. 👎 Developer responds the same way as other critics in the review as if it was a bot replying. Google please take action and remove this app.
Worst ever apps. Lagging, loading, unable to ever enter the first page like 24/7. Apps should make life easier, but this is exactly the opposite way. Thanks to this apps, ill will never use Bank Islam again. Time to change to another stable bank.
Latest app version is super slow. Start to wonder if this app hasn't perform any performance test for the latest build. So frustrated. Cant perform txn coz stuck at splash screen when app launch.
Just please bring back the TAC no and no need GO secure for online transactions. It's suck when everything about the transaction need to go through the apps but the apps are so useless n loading. Why do you all doesn't have any backup plan for your customers? It's so annoying!
I think the previous App was better than now. Not only you cannot access the mobile app page, but when you want to make transfer of money, you need to access/get approval from the mobile app which cannot be accessed. How stupid it is....
Please do something, not reliable. Always facing 'non stop loading' when I want to tap for secure tac when transferring money
Very bad apps,very slow, couldnt ss.. too much time taken to be approved, managed.. hopefully you'll improve your system
pleasee repare the app . soo sloww . sometimes when im urgent wanted to transfer it takes so long to login
Cannot launching, sometimes meed to be wait. And the worst moment is when i need to make a transaction on web, they ask to approve by via app and the app cannot be open. So why do we need thiss app meanwhile it cannot be launching??? Please do something. It almost 3 years ive been used this and it still same like BEFORE
The worst bank I dealt with in my life: It doesn't work with my pixel 6, I can't even use my account on the website because ask me give approval on their app and app does not work.. what stupid poor service they doing, the email doesn't work also!! Plus many more other bad things....
Very Terrible. There's always something wrong with the server and traffic. Make it almost impossible for me to make any payment/money transfer. Annoying and took alot of time to recover. Sometimes, can't event get into the home page. Already uninstall and install the newest version but it become worst than i expected. Please make an improvement abt the app.
Very buggy and now i am unable to log in to my account due to it always stuck at the startup stating, "unable to connect to the server". While, some of my friends are able to use it like normal, but the other friends faced the same thing as me. Very slow in repairing it's bug and problem. Overall, it's disappointing to be honest.
After update the latest version, the apps seem having a lot of trouble..unable to do transaction smoothly.. cannot transfer money and taking more time loading and lastly it will logout suddently
I cannot login to approve my transactions from the web!!! Please fix the app!!! No more SMS TAC so your app is VERY important to function, login also not functioning!!! Update: Help was provided after contact and resolved my issue, bumped the rating stars for this
Please revert back the system to the old one. This new GO is a NO-GO. Not a user friendly at all. The apps keeps crashing and I cannot even log in to system properly.
Everytime update mesti bermasalah! Worst app ever!! Unfriendly, hassle and very irritating!! Transaction were all failed... menyusahkan hidup i! its been 3 days and in consecutive of everytime you all update the system!! What are you guys doing?! Takde usaha nak perbaiki masalah ni ke?! Shows your system and management terrible and weak!
Why this apps always problem? Either with wifi or data. Either bug or loading too long time, taking a very long time to open the apps, and many time 'under maintainence'. Already use this apps for more than 3 years. Please go for some improvements for this apps
2 days i cant log in. They say (unable to connect to server. Please fix this. Edit. ( now tabung haji cant open also).
Why this apps on 23rd until 10th every month can be used smoothly, always crash and need to reinstall back and set up all over again.. i have a bills to pay and i thought online banking are really helpfull my time.. but not on BIMB platform.. please fix this, i been using since 2018 until now same problem coming
Bank Islam app dosen't work at all. Everytime log in, it will take forever to load. The only way is to uninstall and re-install the app. Very inconvenient. In this age of online banking bank islam dont seem to be able to solve simple problem like this. Other banks have no issue on their apps. Very basic problems yet Bank Islam can't solve it. Dosent reflect the islamic or the banking status it deserve. Bank Islam customers are mostly B40 based that explains their typical "tidak apa" attitude.
What the function adding qr code scan system if opening the app take like whole hours to open and what the point to even exist if optimise too slow. Where the fund for the project to utilise and bring comfort and better and easy way if it keep failing us the customer. fixed you for sake of god app!
Unable to open at all most of the time, when u need to access account urgently, not a convinience place to save here
Getting worse. I'm using android ver 13. My internet line is 80-140 Mbps. I just bought new handphone. This is a global problem and not an isolated case. So why need any user that complain to contact the mobileapp when improvement has to be made at higher level. Don't be cheapskate and refused to invest for a better app developer
I can't do any transaction as they need an approval through the app..yet i can't even open the app. This is really frustrating. You should be aware that you've been receiving bad reviews the most. Hope you can fix this matter very soon!
I HATE THIS APPS SO MUCH!! I need to uninstall this apps for getting the secure LOL. Again and again. I am tried! PLEASE FIX IT! Learn from BSNsecure PLEASEE!!
Very bad experience. Try to pay for my korban since last night, even tried at 1am. but after filling up details, go bimb took very long time to show relevant screen then says no instruction for payment. Tried several times. Same experience until now. Who will bear cost - spiritual cost if i still cannot pay through bimb? Previous version much3 better.
Typical server problem. Always high volume of traffic. Fix this problem asap. There's lots of people using this app, and still no action taken. Please, fix this problem. Guna app, berpusing. Guna web, pun ikut pusing. Fix asap, or you'll lose customers/users faster than you realize.
I can use the app only once and then it crashed everytime i want to use the app.
The apps is very no responsive. When we urgently need to transfer fund, we cannot access the apps, when we use web browser ,the approval must via GO. How i want to access my money when i can access the apps??? Really disappointed. This never ending story.
The app refuse to open — even after I waited for long. I can't even see the login screen, merely those pink loading blob that irritated me. I'm not one to leave a bad review, but this is getting ridiculous. Judging by others reviews, I'm not the only one. Please fix this, it's hard for me to do stuff when I can't even access my own money.
Now we can't use website to transfer? It's asking me to go app but the app itself not working properly. Showing errors always, waited for so long but still showing like that. Thought it needs update, but no update available. Regret downloading it.
Can't login after receiving no from no phone it say bad request I already update this app but still same problems already update sign in put REQ registered but can't login
Very inconvenient. Couldnt login in the app and it said to use the web version. But when I tried to do a transfer, it said to use the app to approve the payment. I wish there's an easier way to use Bank Islam.
Shittiest bank app in Malaysia. Cannot even open because it is so slow. Ugliest interface too.
very awful apps...lagging and lagging and lagging. I really wonder whether any QC or improvement done for this apps. totally frustrated use. The share button hardly any use whenever we want to share proof of transaction. please do some job!
Everytime I need to use online transactions this apps keep on alert server not available. So then I need to uninstall and then install again. Why this keep happening. Can you create a better functional apps to ease the customer.
I had operating system above 9, but why the app did not function. Everytime I open the app, it stated unable to connect to the server. There so many things I need to pay through this app. Please help me.
This is my first time using this app and it it the worst. I already had problems using it and now i facing the connection problem i have a stable connection but the app said it is untrusted connection. What does it mean?? Please fix it immediately
The worst online banking apps..Not convinience to use because always stuck at front page or loading time took longer whenever want to check balance or make transanction using this apps. Kindly upgrade it..
cant do internal transfer for my investment account and savings account anymore, it says exceed limit. there was no problem before, please fix this, already updated the limit,but still the same
Why when using online banking from web browser quite fast, but thru app can't connect to the login? Using different server or the app's connectivity very bad? Please fix it as some transaction need to go through Go Bank app.
Suck and hard to get access. When require fast transaction in any store it make it headache. From 2016 until now doesnt have much improvement by BIMB. Really disappointed on failure of management team BIMB.
Worst apps ever... Hard to make a transaction due to lag and endless loading.. i thought banking apps supposed to make my life easier.. but when i need to make a transaction through biz page.. i still need an approval of my transaction through these slow apps.. useless..
I dont even know what happening with this app anymore. i cant even open the apps and used it to pay online. It said server error continuously. Everytime i need to pay online i have to open this app and approve the payment but this app didnt work at all. Let me just use TAC if this app have a problem .this is worst.
Worst apps...always loading...I can't use online transfer just because must validate by this apps... in the end still to use old system go to ATM and transfer via machine
It's always says cannot connect to server. I cannot use this app at all. Please improve your app or i should change my bank soon.
Good and improved on the accessibility. Keep going to serve better.
I got error all the time went to sign in... I need to uninstall and install again.. And it will be the same.. The application take more time then last version...
Can't connect to the server, for days. Good job screwing up the fund to develop the apps, BIMB
App is not working at all. It keeps showing the loading icon. Thanks to not working I am unable to approve transfers when using rhe website instead
Always error, dont create app if always be like this,.. need to open website everytime.. From IOS to Android still facing the same problem. Poor technical system
Apps bugs for many time when i used to pay with qr.. Long queue rear me for paying ahhh lukcily can put atleast 1 star if dont i wont rates even 1 star
Still worse after update on latest version. Lag, didnt show account history, qr pun loading, disarankan bertukar ke bank lain
System very slow during login.. sometime need to re-install the app then can use..
App updated. Unable to access service. Bad app. Response from admin also bad. Bank Islam get this sort out
As i using it,this apps become more stable and smooth than before, keep it up 🤗
New version has better than previous version. Good improvement for Bank Islam. Proceed with tagline 'Assuring Trust. Delivering Value'.
Takes forever to load, very slow, please fix the loading time issue
very baddddd. always cannot open. always server error!
Still bad service...slow maintenance...I can't even do anything through website or application
Apps keep stuck before login page. Your apps and server is made up of a potato or what?
The apps enlighten my routine. Its futuristic and fast.
So inconvenience. Lag almost all the time. Please please please improve this app
I rated 1 star in 2019 (deleted) and i can now attest that Go has made so much improvements. Go, you deserve 5 stars.
Easy to use even for beginner with appropriate button function
The apps is always unable to connect to the server
take so much time just to check my balance, it keeps giving server error😌
Straightforward to use and app has been improving over time!
too bad, always need to update, poor servers .
apps yg sgt tidak membantu,nak log in pon susa,x dpt..buffer..pakai chrome ok je log in..tp x guna gak klau pki chrome nk buat approval kne log in apps gk..benda ni da lama x de improvement pon..please la BIMB learn from others bank apps such as HLB very effsien n convenient..
Very disappointed with the apps, apps keep lagging, hanging. It takes too long even to log in and it just keep crashing. Just do something about it. 1/5 star
Not even worth for 1 star. Please do something about the update. As user, we called contact centre, emailed to mobileadmin.. No useful feedback is given... But for dis time, after update, dont uninstall & reinstall back. U will face cooling off for 12 HOURS. ALL TRANSACTIONS CANNOT DO.. So please, increase your patience or change to other bank...
Unable to connect to server. And still the same even already update the apps :(
Why during Im buying foods you decided to be unavailable its hard yk I need the money seriously can you hurry up I need to use the card seriously I couldn't even pay for the food bc of the maintenance
Very bad poor app for banking..need to upgrade like other banking system..not friendly user..dissapointed
Am having trouble downloading mobile transaction receipt, whereby nothing is downloaded.. its blank if share!!!
I cannot open the app since I downloaded the new version. It kept showing the Unable to Connect to Server box everytime I open the app. I have been using it for 2 years and it got its up and down, but this time is the worst. And since everything needed to be aunthenticate using the Go app, I found it very inconvenient and a huge hassle. Please do something about it. Thank you.
Very lousy apps. I think lot of people already acknowledged the issue so i have nothing more to say
Keep crashing and unable to connect to server
Worst apps i had used, always buffering and can not log in ..who's your IT department pic for server ..should change that person ..
Hire someone can fix this apps asapla. Aiyoo. Big company but loading time never improve.

Too slow to open, missed my transaction. Latest app version.
Seriously..just go back using pin number..using this app to confirm every purchase is nightmare..
Hire some better developers. Super slow app, assuming it's actually loading at all
Not so convenience to use for the waiting time. Need to always update.

I actually wanted to give this app five stars, but after seeing the rating which is 1.3...then I decided to give 1 star...in simple words, I want to set the rating to always be 1...AHAHAHAHAH 🤣🤣 poor "bank islam".
After a new update this week it seems even worst than previous, Cant even open always loading
if u cannot give better service then dont forced us to use ur apps..make many people in trouble..please take note with a lot of comment here n there..n pls do improve it
What kind of app that keep getting slower after update. All they can do is say sorry and after a year waiting for improvement, it keep getting worse with heavy traffic and all. WARNING just delete the app and have better life using other bangking app.
Really bad experience with this apps, always hanging..round and round but not appear. Want to do online, ask to use this apps but always fail..
New apps so sucks.. Make me stress to use it.. Waiting so long and still loading...
Hi there. Just want to highlight an issue where whenever I tried to set up a new favourite account, or adjusting any setting in the apps, out of the blue, there will be a pop up saying "No valid session...". And I will be forced to log out. This occur not only once, but a few time that I got so annoyed and irritated. Kindly take a prompt action to fix this tq
To slow...update for nothing...pls upgrade your system...bodo punya apps....menyusahkan user....slow mau mampus...xpayah update la kalau slow...
Could you separate your ATM locations and branch locations because the branch locator is mixed up with ATM locations. I want to search for a branch.
A good initiative. Had been using it for a while and had decent exp. But I can't put myself to give a better rating when the app keeps on crashing after an update. Never have I ever have to uninstall & reinstall an app per update. & don't get me start with the lag. Even when my data is good, the app failed to load. Please make an effort to repair these bugs. Tiring & malfunctioning as well. On a flip side, it feels safe to use. Won't use anymore unless necessary.
New version is horrible terible, loading is too long and doesn't allow to screenshot. Old version is better. Not statified with the current version.
Took long time to load, please fix for most Android device
Useless app, loading to long. During emergency time need to transfer money suddenly unable to open app. Really hope for improvement. I'm thinking of switching to maybank after this. Good bye Go bank islam.
Bad bad bad .please developed the software with better performance .check the cache .possibility how the data been transfered.take care about time processing and multhreathing.the ui is good but the performance out
Take time for loading. Sometimes it took half an hour. I try to log in using chrome to make online transfer but it still require me to use go secure in the apps. 😮‍💨😮‍💨 Please fix your apps. Thank you
Soooo slow to open the app... the loading took so long... very difficult to check my statement bcs it's always got prob. Very bad app.. always have prob and it took me so long to open app especially when I'm in urgent. Really need to be improve!!!!!
Just so terrible & annoying, this is the worst banking app i ever used, now its latest feature introduced verification through the app when you want to make an online transactions, i can't even login the app..everytime i wanna do a transaction, i need to go to nearest atm..so what's the point of this trash app anyway, so useless..
A really bad app. Cannot login. But i cannot do transaction from internet banking. I need to get the secure code from the app, but the app cannot be opened. Maybank is way much better than this. Its a total failure for me. It should have been 0 star from me.
I download this to experience a much better and faster services, but end up got more lagging, more waiting and in the end cant even function properly... Quite disappointed to be honest.. update:imma change the rating to 5* now since it work well. Thanks for your hardwork~
Slow, very bad.. i need to wait for so long, but most of the time it didnt load at all!! Do something....dont launch an app, if it is not ready .. TAP was much more reliable than GO
In-app purchase authorization (GO-secure) crashed continuously despite good internet connectivity. OTP system usually okay (but lagged in sending the code also at some point) but the latter is way laggy and worse.
I don't know whether the apps is useless or it is useless but its uselees either way. Service not available, glitching, loading.. doing online banking but need to approve transaction on apps and yet the apps crashing.. why there is no improvement made despite bunch of complaints
The worst online banking app in Malaysia, no doubt. For 3 days I cannot make any payment due to high traffic, high volume, error and whatsoever. Just imagine if you only have 1 bank that use online banking. You can't make any transfer, can't pay bill, can't do online purchases. Please upgrade your system. Go find new tender, new company to handle the server. I'm sick of it and I'm on the way to change to another bank.
Totally trash and unreliable apps. It look like the bank hire the intern to develop the apps. Always have issue to start the app especially during online payment. Please improve
Always getting high traffic error when payday. There has been no improvement for the past few months to solve the issue. I cant use the apps on payday.
I can't make any payment. the app keep loading. wasting time. fyi the app is updated. WiFi also excellent. the app is the issue. please bring IAC back.
Worst appplication ever. You are making it compulsory for verification via go by bank islam for each transaction but the apps is not functioning most of the time. This is so annoying and cause lots of problem for the user during transaction.
Very disappointing, please improve your app service, as there's now a mandatory to approve any transaction using the app. If the app keep stuck at the loading screen how on earth we cam complete the transaction
I literally just wanted to buy top up but the website ask me to download this before I can proceed with my purchase, trying to login into the app takes so much time that the timer had already been expired and I can't even get past the Bank Islam logo😠, consider switching to another bank that has a better mobile app experience than this app
Is a very rubbish app. Why already so many people complaining about this app and still don't want solve the problem are you just ignore what the things that people complaining at here? The app keep on cannot log in keep on say error and I want to reload e wallet need to go the app to approve it I cannot make it also want to use online pay also also need the app to approve. What for make people difficult if this keep on happening and we cannot make our things done and no any improvement.
Bank Islam can you improve your app it really slow like turtle then i can't even login to my acc because of it keeps loading, do better and find someone that can fix your app. I have been using this app for 2 years and the problem still the same please fix to make it more better
lagging and slow. if we have to use this apps to make an approval of transaction please keep this apps always in good maintenance and friendly useable. been hours waiting and lagging just to make an approval transaction. or please provide for users to choose either approve using TAC or this ridiculous apps. i just want the best for BANK ISLAM
It is veryyyy slow. Oftentime when i wanna authorize any transaction using go by bank islam, i have to do it 4-5 times because it keeps loading. There are times i couldnt proceed with the authorization at all. Please bank islam. Upgrade your app.
I don't know what's wrong with this app,every time I try to login,it don't allow me to do so..I already put the right password,but still it didn't work out..and always lag,hope so it soon will be fix..
Always problem with the internet connection. No matter how many update. Used to be fine with the website. But now can't do any transaction in it anymore without using the app.
After updated more loading! Use website also need to approve on apps! It has been 2 years this apps got problem and still can't solve it! All are SINECURE! It's so annoying! Worseeeee apps ever! Waste time and slowww!
Difficult to use. Internet banking more convenient before. But still need to approved by GO app and delayed internet banking transaction. Not all people have big phone storage just for all kind of apps.
Whenever I'm opening the app the only thing it says unable to connect to the server. Even though I update the app same problem every time. So irritated.
I have to wait so long before i can make transaction. Please improve. Sometimes, i can't even open this apps if i have some emergency transaction. Please improve this apps. Don't make it worse!. Please.
The worst app you can possibly imagine. Please provide a service that you can deliver, if not just cancel it out. Take a verrryyyyyyyy long time to log in, to scan qr. It just DON'T WORK OUT. Please don't say we sorry to hear your problem etc etc. Just get it fixxxxxxed okay. TQ
This app is a way for the bank itself to scam its patrons. With how the bank forces patrons to use this non-functioning app to make any transfers. Its best to just close the account and go to another bank.
I need to approve transaction on the app but it keep getting error 500. Being trying for few days already in hoping it back to normal. Now I'm late to pay for things because of this app. QR also so slow. Hope the team can have a full testing on the app before release to public. Thank you
stupid app. on hari gaji day cannot log in due to high volume traffic. it said for alternative to use the website. but when do the transaction with the website they need the secure code that is sent to the app. so cannot do also. stupid
Don't know how to say,but I'm really disappointed, because of this app, i rather like the old version cause it can access fast and quick, rather than this version, i know the future in this app are improving,but please improve the system also, worst
worst banking apps ever! Keep loading ended up with server error and taking like ages just to do simple onlind transfer. The apps really testing my patience!! Latest update June23: I thought Bank Islam GO improved! But worsen. Keep telling us to clear cache, but nothing good is happening! Please remove requirement to use GO if your apps capability and quality is not yet UP to minimum standard expected! Feeling frustrated as LOYAL client of Bank Islam for yearsssss!
the app becoming more worse than ever.. every transaction more than Rm100 need to approve from this very baaaaaaaaaaaaaadd app, and yet user can't even login.. its keep buffering FOREVER! fix this already.. its been months i've tolerated, clearing cache everytime i need to login.. you've done NOTHING to improve
so bad. took too long to login even when not on payday. maybank2u is much better. how logically could u think that it keep saying high traffic whenever i tried to login while my friends could easily login. i am sure that this is not about phone issue
I dont understand why the apps is slow. I'd rather doing the online banking using google chrome. It is faster compared to the apps itself. I hope Bank Islam will address this issue as soon as possible
No offense, I know it is the goverment orders to use secure2u in mobile apps for verification relating to any online payments but you gotta fix the unstable problems of your mobile apps as soon as possible, guys. It's hindering day to day operations.
It always have an issues such as hard to log in, take very long time when loading and unable to connect with server. I'm sick of this kind of problems. Please fix it.
I tend not to give any star for the apps..... Always stuck at startup and cannot login this apps.... More than a month this issue still status quo.. Not sure what are the action taken by Bank Islam team.....if there is a chance, for sure will transfer all to another bank acc....
Dear team..why i cannot open the app?it keep saying "unable to connect server".i already install and uninstall many time..this is the third day i keep install and uninstall...i notice when have event on that month bank islam apps will be crash every day..please improve your trafic to avoid this kind of situation..this is second time i comment at here..but still no improvement.
I need to make a important transfer right now and the app is not working like it took too much time for loading and it sign out it own. Really really bad experience and so disappointed with this app right now.
App is laggy and full of error. I have uninstalled and reinstalled. But still cannot open the app. It stated that error 500. Please do something! I cannot transfer my money online because the approval need to be done on apps
Always experiencing failed transactions when I start to use this Go App system. I really don't like it. Not convenient to use it. It's better for not using this system. I think I should use other bank.
Frustrating, tried to make a transaction by web because the apps won't stop load and stuck on the welcome page, but then after inputing all the info required still need to approve the web transaction by apps which i can't open hmmmm
Worst apps ever. They keep loading all the time. However, I can smoothly use the other bank apps, so it's not an issue with my internet connection. I had no problems when using Chrome for bank Islam Internet banking
The most irritating online banking app. Now need to approve in bank Islam Go for online transaction, while I cannot even access to the app. Gosh need to do something about it. Always unavailable. So not helpful at all.
How did you managed to mess it up? it was doing fine before. right now its just impossible to even log into the app. loads forever and suddenly system is currently unavailable.
The worst ever apps compared to other competitor banks. Unable to open, keep loading and loading... Once u able to login, keep delayed in receiving the TAC... So many issues...bad customer experience...
Really great to whomever force this app of any transaction. Who's idea would great enough to forcely link any transaction with an app so buggy. Bring back message code! This app is not suitable for older phone!!!
As a customer, I am gonna be very honest. Did you see all the bad reviews here? Everyone of them filed the same complain and it seems you did not take any action for the matter. If that does not ring a bell, let me tell you the problem, your apps are extremely lagging, it frequently jammed which cause my transaction cancelled, I am embarassed when the cashier waiting for me to pay for 30 MINUTES, 30 MINUTES, I'm not even exaggerate, this happens too often. You must fix the problems immidiately.
Very poor apps, even no issue with Internet speed, the apps still lag for a few minutes. Most stressful bcoz need to approve transactions via go secure but apps hang to open
First time login, masuk kan sms FA, error 500 Edit: switch lines & retry. Work like a charm. Edit2: everytime there's new update I have to key in password and set fingerprint setting again, this is stupid and wasting time. Please fired your app vendor!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What can i say. I am a truly frustrated, disappointed user. This apps is way below the normal standard of other online banking apps such as m2u, cimbclicks etc. I would even give 0 star if google allows me to! Update 24/6/2023: This apps is still suxx. No improvement at all. Even worse than before. I would still go for 0 star!
Bad experience. Slow apps just to load the login page. For certain payment, need approval from apps, but this apps stuck. Please invest to improve and overcome the bottleneck especially on the salary day.
Having a nightmare with this app, keeps on circling until the requested times are up. Not once, can't recalled the experience. Truly disaster
This app really make my business even worse. Take a really long time to loading which I need to delay my important transaction just to wait it loading. The server always error. Really hard to go with this app.
This apps was performing from normal to bad . Now going from bad to worse. Please do something. Upgrade it, make it faster and don't forget about improving it's safety features.
The worst online banking app in the history ever made! What kind of degen software developers that you hired huh? I can't even open the app after the update. Takes 9999 years to load! If you can't be sure that this app can performs flawlessly then don't publish at all! Just stick to the website one man! You're losing a lot of customers here trust me! And I'm wasting googolplex of my timea Not recommended at all!
Dear bank islam....just delete this app from Google play. This app exist just to ruin my day and my storage...if it's won't able to function well then there is no reason for it to exist. It's been a decade and this problem seem to be remain unsolved like forever. Thanks for providing stupidest online banking app ever 👍. Just don't wanna harsh but if soft spoken won't so why don't?
Please hire someone that really good in IT. So, your user can using this app easily and more faster like a cheetah. Your apps now is almost being near with useless. PLEASE FIX IT!! FIX IT!! FIX IT!!
I need to APPROVE my transaction with this app, but this app can't even open!! You do realise that people have to do transaction on the web BECAUSE the app DOESN'T WORKK!! Now you want us to use your useless app to approve that transaction?! Who's stupid idea was this??!! Worst banking app I've ever experienced!! Just abolish the app and focus on the web!! The app is an epic FAILURE!!!!!
They always pending my transaction.. my money also successful transfer but when i check in another account, my money still stuck. it happened 2x to me and now i stuck again my transaction! Please improve your system !
I'm out of words. Really. Setiap update membuat app bertambah teruk. I am not even sure whether our complaints are taken into account, it looks like we are replied by the bot. Tak tahu apa solusi tech team Bank Islam untuk masalah berpanjangan mengenai app, bertahun-tahun ini. Menyusahkan keadaan. Transactions perlu approved melalui app, and yet the app itself failed to load at THE VERY BEGINNING OF LAUNCH. Transaksi kami ni jenaka ke, bagi Bank Islam?
This is worst app experienced that I ever had... The loading screen took way too long and sometimes you cant even open the app for the whole day. This have caused me lot of problem
The app is slow even though my internet connection is good because the other apps are okay. I can open them fast but not this app. Thank you Update: Assalamualaikum bank islam. Saya rasa pihak bank islam dah sedia maklum tentang apps online banking yang sangat slow. Ramai cakap benda sama. Saya rasa boleh slowly take action instead of suruh buat aduan kat email etc.
12/07 - I had to install and uninstall it a few times. Not just normal update. Super stress!!! Hari ni nak login tak boleh keluar error 500 APZ_TSN_500. Apa ni Bank Islam, ulang tahun ke 40, servis makin teruk. 14/07 - 2 times transaction failed because of loading time took more than 3 minutes. Bank Islam tolonglah upgrade server.
Buggy, loading... if happen surely need re-install back. Edited: Now the response getting ok. Just my favourite from website not available in apps, need to re-add. Overall ok easy, good & smooth. #keepitup
Previous version more compatible compared for right know. Keep loading and crash. Please⁹x,make iit be an enjoyable apps ro use. Not getting more stress from it
Always problematic to open. Now for the past few days, i continuously getting error to open the app. Trying to uninstall and reinstall. Same problem. Truly useless app.
The apps is super duper lagginggggg!! Sometime after the long wait can login to the system but sometime will just show error message! Clear cache multiple times also not working 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I need to use the apps to do online transactio but can't even open the apps. Loading je memanjang..tekan ape2 keluar blank page..stop depend on the apps if the apps is always crash.
Slow, then suddenly my account have a limit for transferring to other accounts even though it is less than the daily limit set beforehand. Try asking help from support but its useless.
the latest version for bank islam is so disappointed. it make hard to the late version of phone to be install that application especially for the older one . is it the best that you can do for the people who was using ur application ? if this keep happening, it's only make people to choose another bank 😤
Very slow. Please improve your app. After all these years of update, transaction become worsed as you still need to open the apps even using web biz page. Very unprofessional of handling customer complaints. Shameful
Previous version much better than new update. To Developer this app supposed to help user & enhanced ur security not give burden on them. Manager, Sales, Pre-Sales, Marketing & Developer please improved your application before we change to used other services. Thank you.
Before this the app is just okay, but yesterday an error message keeps popping up and wouldn't disappear and I cannot make any transactions using Bank Islam. I have Deleted the app yesterday.
Worst mobile banking app ever, slow and sometimes just does not work. If in an emergency the person would have died waiting for the app to start.
ALWAYS UNABLE TO CONNECT TO THE SERVER / NO FUNCTION Cannot approve the transaction since cannot login into the Go by Bank Islam apps. VERY STUPID apps. NOTORIOUS for crashing. Like always the pegawai bank will only say sorry for inconvenience. The fact is, on customer's part, it is not inconvenience but a difficult hindrance to the transaction. TAKE NOTE BANK ISLAM. DON'T BE BITTER WITH THIS COMMENT BUT GET BETTER!!
I guess it is either the dev team is underpaid or you lots just plain idiot with no brain. Wasted half an hour just to make an instant transfer to another account. I don't wish you guys the dev team success. The Dev team doesn't deserve to be happy or successful in this world due to their "phenomenal" banking app. No improvements since the last 3-4 years. Lazy developers!
This app so problematic, try to login since yesterday and still its loading though I have good internet. I couldn't make any payments. Even CIMB I can login with 512 kbs when I'm run out of data.
too bad when opening his apps, always loading. why is this happening? his service is too bad. It's really hard for me to transfer money to other people because it's hard to open their apps, just load them Please take immediate action.tq
As a student using bank islam is really difficult.Because most off the time this app is not working properly.if we want to top up or transfer the money it's really hard for us. Most of the time this app is not working properly....
Very unfriendly user. Takes a very long time to load. Unexpected time to make a maintenance and everything bad combine in one app
recently using this app is difficult and unpleasant, since it takes too long to open and also frequently not responding. very frustrating since i cant settle my bills and payment as planned.
Suddenly show a server network error and even after reinstall the app, its good for a few hours then the same thing happen again. Fix this thing
The worst ever. Install uninstall for three times. Still cannot open the apps. Better dont have the apps if its can't be open or lagging all the time.
So far the slowest mobile Internet banking app i ever used..still can't open the apps after 10 minutes waiting.. Affect my payment / transfer every month.. Bank islam should have assess again this apps.. Using website is better, but still need secure number from apps..
I'm sorry but please please please hire someone who can really do the jobs right. Why this app always laggy and buggy.. why it keeps reloading... how many times do I have to keep key in the information.. so not user friendly
Worst app ever. Might consider to change to other banks if you don't improve / upgrade your apps. Update on 25/6/23: still cannot use. Don't bother to download this app. USELESS
I was using bank Islam website to transfer but couldnt and the website told me to download the apps. Now i cant even login the apps because there is error popup. The worst apps, service and a waste of time.
Please improved the apps for better experience..regret to use it as my main bank transaction...anything related on online payment so lembap bapak lahh..link with go transactions not sync, pending and transaction will be invalid..did not sure amount transaction were deducted or not..to open apps / using qr paid kena sidai macam hape.bende laa bank apps mcam ni.letihlaa...
I couldn't even open up the apps, such a bummer! I need to do instant transfer, but the apps didn't help at all. Do better with the apps Bank Islam..
I don't know what happened but it seems I can't log in into my account, is it under maintenance? Because it always log out when I'm login. Hard for me to make transaction
Please improve your system. Seriously so stress when people using to play. 1st thing is the GO app. No need actually when we using OTP. Then always system is currently not available. My God seriously so stressed. improve improve improve please🙏🏽
Worst application ever. The application should be more easier but became more harder. Cannot use the application at all. I even cannot pay my bill.
The slowest apps that universe can handle. I think, it is faster to go to the bank, take a number and que at the counter just to know my account balance than waiting this app to load.
The previous one i think much better. The new version i cant even log in, it just keep on loading and loading 🙂 please fix the issue.
Can't open the app for so long. How to transfer my money?? Even when i'm trying to topup my shopee pay, I cant use this bank because I need to open the app to authorize the transaction. Please improve asap 😠
(Edited) Now, the app navigation seems ok for me. So i add 2 star more from my original 1 star review before. Also, for not be able to see my transactions history pains me. So no more star for you for now
VERY VERY BAD!!!! WHY THE SYSTEM IS VERY SLOW UNLIKE MAYBANK. Bfr this, I can buy the ticket without need to download the go bank Islam apps. But today suddenly I must use the app to settle the payment. This app is very bad & please do not trouble us as the bank Islam users with your bad system.
Trash apps, sorry for the harsh word but come on Bank Islam? Already 2021 but still with this kind of apps. Hardly stable to use. People use mobile apps for convenience not to get more headache haiya. Update : 2023 still trash. Both website and mobile apps cannot be used at all. Don't bother using Bank Islam anymore
Update your system properly. What's the use of keep updating but the outcome got worse. Ugh if it's not for my uni i would never use this trashy app. BANK ISLAM PLEASE IMPROVE YOUR SYSTEM. THE PROBLEM HAS ONGOING FOR SO LONG BUT THERE'S NO ACTION TAKEN? WORST BANKING APP EVER
i want to review without giving A star actually. This app always bug . if i uninstall and install back, i have to wait another 12 hours so i can use the transfer method and others . what a problematic app . VERY TROUBLESOME .
Always high volume of traffic. Not ideal for emergency. Loading time takes too long. Need more than 10 minutes just to load up QR.
This app is really terrible. It's always have problems and when you enter the app, it's take too much time to load. Mybank app is better in my opinion.
I can't even open the apps after the update! Worst banking apps ever. It make the transactions more difficult/ almost impossible!!!
I want to online transfer, but due to apps server error, i need to wait until it's okay. No option like TAC or other if something happen like this. Poor apps.
Slowest apps to be honest..Please take your users opinion for better result..We suffer more than anyone everytime we try to make transition,transfer and everything..Please make sure your apps run more smoothly..TQ
Super slow after updates, login, transaction ,then after finish transfer ,it log out ,then try to login again, access denied. Done reinstall. Still problem occur .please check .
Downloaded it for the first time today and all I get is "Server Error: Unable to connect to the server". What a waste of time. Not going to bother trying it later in the future if it can't even function.
Trying to open the apps but got an issues on the server, tried to uninstall it but until today its failed, please resolve this issues ASAP (15/12/22). UNTIL TODAY THIS IS ISSUES IS NOT RESOLVE (02/08/23)
Please bank Islam improve your application. It takes time to open and sometimes there have many errors.. It's easy to use but the loading and errors make me annoyed.
Recevied error message "Reach maximun of user id". After de-listed user and add new user. Please fix this issue. I believe this is only minor issue.
I wanted to do the transaction request from other app, then it asked me to redirect to this app to continue the transaction. But when i opened this app, it suddenly said "please reinitiate the transaction" and the app stuck with that popup window.
Too Slow and unstable. Its year 2023. Even a 'Car Wash' business has an apps now. Your internal budget for online banking apps and marketing must have been gone to somewhere else,i predict. Lastly, 'Riba' is haram😁
Really disappointing with the BANK ISLAM application, it should be easier for every customer when they want to make an online transaction, there must be a problem, please fix it don't waste the customer's time many times have faced this problem very disappointing.
Just updated today and your app just gave me an "Error 500" What does that mean and I've tried uninstall and reinstall a couple of times but it still gives me that error code 500.. please help!
cant login. the same id and password were use in desktop,but keep on sying "invlid credential" in apps. i cant transfer money as the desktop online bankin ask to install this app to setup something at its setting. now useless.
Bad service ever, i wanted to login but keep denying even though already put the right password, then i have to wait within 12 hours before i can proceed for any payment after change the password, please make sure to update this thing
Worst bank app. Most of the time cannot login, high traffic error, lag & slow. I will rate 0 star if given the option.
The bank fund did not reflect the amount I have in my account. When open via website, it shows the amount. But in the app only show zero ringgit.
Slow when open the app and even slower when opened using mobile data. Please fix it ASAP, a lot of people using duitnow and online banking for everyday transaction.
Apps always problem and slow response. Its not convenient if you are in a hurry. This is the worse banking app period.!
Take a long time to just load the screen. For what forcing us to stop using the website and use the apps . Seriously ? Not convenience
Hello Bank Islam, what kind of improve if your apps always stuck and loading? Really troubling the user. The most trouble apps bank that i used, sorry not gonna used this apps anymore, you guys never take this as lesson. Bye forever and ever !!
the application is really bad .. it's been two days since I've been trying to enter or login , I can't .. oh my god . It's hard to make a transaction..
Forced to install to enable online transfer. Installed, went through all the stupid steps, logged me off multiple times. 2 hours in I still can't do anything. Modern day robbery.
Apps is SOOOO problematic. HAVE TO REACTIVATE QR CODE FOR EVERY.SINGLE.USE??!! LOAD TIME?FOREVER EVEN WITH WIFI😑 you update the apps but nothing happens 😩
Very slow apps, difficult to do online transaction (always received error), cannot use screenshot for proof of payment use, always received error so many times, very bad apps...
Please acknowledge all the reviews you received. This apps received 1 star for most of the ratings and bad feedbacks but still no improvement from the admin. Please do something and improve your apps. This apps just make things harder. Even 1 star is over rating.
The worst app i have been used. Update , update, update but nothing improve. Each transaction (above limit) need to approve by app, but cannot open to approve. So HOW? Really annoyed. Does not deserve even for 1 star. Shd be 0.
Not even worth of one star. Slow, sluggish. Login using fingerprint will fail most of the time.
Bro..seriously, i am in urgent to do the transaction and the apps keep on crashing. Open by browser, and need to confirm transaction by using this apps. Seriously?
Very bad system. Doing the transaction online always on lag i can die because of this system makes my food transaction always failed. Shame on you.
The current version is take time to open compared to old version. It's really annoyed. Please upgrade the system.
Cannot even start the app, now online banking through regular web cannot perform online transaction, what other option the user has for online transaction then? Please fix the app. Thank you
Disappointed!! The worse apps in my phone. Eventhough Im using browser, i still need to authorised my transaction through this apps. The problem is i can't even open it. Shame on you bank islam.
Bank islam service didn't improve their log in apps delay even few years. Very bad
Loading takes forever using Redmi note 11s but run smoothly on redmi note 11 pro 5g.
Why got problem when to open ? The app want loading until when ?? Until I have child or i die ? I can't to make payment ! It's so very double triple bad !! Very and very triple disappointed !!!
I do not know why the app so lagging. This really affect my transactions for biz. Have to restart over and over end up using on the web to transfer.
Too many error. From log in up to transferring fund. Please fix the apps, or just remove it from apps store if u are not going to fix it
Bila nak upgrade apps ni? Basic function pun tak tercapai. Duk loading memanjang. Malu la sikit dengan apps Maybank. Contohi apps mereka. . Update: developer noob. Cannot provide even the basic function of the apps
This stupid thing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!@@×!×@!×+I can't load to the app. It's says cannot connect to server. Have been trying many times, still failed 😔
I found that the latest fixes/releases makes this apps better and user friendly
The apps keep on loading until time to do transactions out. Worst banking apps ever.. I had to go to the bank to do it manually..
Please upgrade your apps, hard to access. Sometimes need to wait loading for long time before and after login. Functionality too slow..2 star at the moment until its run smoothly
Very bad experience with this app, please upgrade your system. Poor, incompetent, waste of time, awful at the every corner...
Pls fix ur server or whtever issue it is. I hve experiencing ths issue since ths early 2023 n i have limited patience. I hve been considering changing my bank acc bcos of ths apps
not even worth 1 star. just like other reviewer, the app is now worse after the update. Loading takes forever, online transaction took so long despite having fast internet. Lagi update lagi teruk hmmm
Not deserve a star at all. BIMB need to do drastically changes to make sure this app functionally correctly. Else, it will leads to customer loss to other conventional bank services.
App doesnt do anything (almost all time i used it)! DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING IF IT IS NOT BROKEN!
It takes too long to loading.. And the apps crashed frequently.. it makes it hard to get approval for duitnow system..
Horrible.What is wrong with your apps? Now it is very slow to access my account.It keep on logging, until I give up.. You must keep up with other banks' app!
Previous version much better. Current version always lagging & it is troublesome when i want to use it urgently. Hopefully BIMB can do something.
Always error opening the app. Showing high traffic everytime !!! How to confir. TAC if app always crash ?? Shame lah u manage this app. 😡😡
Lembap gile app ni...nak open app took very long period that I can made coffee baru bole bukak... sometimes the app cannot open cause having inconvenient problem... developer please improve this damn app and fix the problem...other bank apps work smoothly but this app work very dull
Bagus. The banking app has been improved a lot! Thanks!
The apps cannot open or even to register. Also, you need to open the apps for approval transaction even you are doing money transfer through website.stupid application.
if theres a zero star review i would give it to this app...Like seriously?...Why do you need to make a payment everytime we need to go through the app? its stupid and slow
Too bad the apps so bad la. 2 days waiting to make transaction still cannot do. Using website also crashed. Please make an improvement asap.
Very slow. Rubbish app. Sorry to say.
After update cannot open the apps until today.Pervious apps more better.
Update review: JUST PERISH! My balance was deducted when I am sure I never made any transaction recently. This is after updating the app as of 2 oct 2023. App keep showing no transaction history at all! The worst banking app ever. Slow loading, not to mention you have to log in to this trashy banking app whenever you need to verify online transactions through go secure, but sometimes it doesn't even show up. Update and UPGRADE your feature and loading rate or just terminate this app entirely.
Another update and yet this app still disapponts. This time, merely logging in to the app itself is time consuming and stress-inducing; let alone performing online banking transactions via the app, God knows how long it will take. My previous review prevails with add-ons to the already long complaint. Rather appalling given the slow page loading and difficulty of connecting to the app. It was quite frustrating and inconvenient when the app was supposed to have 'streamlined' online banking.
Apps always lagging, some times not responsed, please solve the problem a.s.a.p
Very very bad services. Apps cannot be open and seldomly successful to make transaction. Hoping there will be improvement in near future
The apps keep loading and unable to login.
The worst bank app ever! Its always loading and takes too much time for me to use qr pay. I end up using other bank app which is more fast and efficient
Worst experience ever. Loading takes forever. Simple assignment cannot be done. Plan your schedule weeks ahead or just accept that nothing can be done through this app
Using this apps for quite long and already updated the latest version,but i'm still don't see the improvement using this apps. Worst and too slow.
It's very, way too annoying! Don't bother making an app if you don't intend for it to work! It's been a year or more since I have this app and it keeps crashing all the time. Can count with my finger how many times it work during a year! Please fix this or just delete this app from the playstore, u r making its hard since want to pay shoppee also got through this piece of app!
Can't even open smh.. Alr update, now can open but cannot log in..
Worst working apps. That's I can conclude about this apps..unable to connect to server, traffic bla bla bla. So frustrated.
Apps cant login. Wth is this!? Why do we need to get the securego from the apps when the apps can't even open?! Please fix! I have tons of bills to pay wih due dates!!!
Whoever in charge with developing this app should resign, not competent at all, most of the time not working
I have tried many times to login still cannot login and the password is wrong eventhough i have entered the password correctly. Still having the same problem
This app has been the lousiest since from the beginning. I hope the team will rectify the issue. Everytime error!
the most retarded app on planet, how could this app still exists at this moment. even a snail would be faster than this app, and whose idea was it to confirm the online purchase through this stupid app and thought it would be a great idea when it is slow as hell ?
Its sincerely getting worse!! Its keep loading without getting anywhere. Please fix this asap.. Ppl use it everyday.. If we just open it for it to be loading, then what the point???
Poor app. Not go for user friendly. Not easy to access. Unable to connect the server 😞😞😞
Not happy with the apps efficiency. Loading, loading, loading until the time ended. Please improve your efficiency. So upset
Please fire all of your swqa and dev team and management , lots of bugs in this app slow loading time, lots of items in app dissappearing reappearing randomly
Bank Islam Go is testing my patience. Banyak kena istighfar, banyak kena ingat kepada Allah because when you need to open the app, you can't because of high volume or because they're experiencing technical issues. Fix the app, Bank Islam, once and for good.
As of now (6/11/23 11.51pm) the app stays on loading page. Tried with different type of internet connection but it's still loading. Didn't have any issues through bimb webpage. Only the app. Already tried to restart the phone and open the app again though. P. S: after reading all the recent reviews, makes me wonder, does the latest version of the app is still very bad?
Fixed the rooted device issue on my last review. It gets the job done, but not in optimal way. I'd rather browsing through website compared to this. Loading each page was slow, even website version load faster. Whenever I wanted to do transfer be it IBG or Instant Transfer, I have to reinput my password again. I cannot use fingerprint authentication, as it was only for first app login. Another hassle for me.
Trash app. Can't even load the login page
I cannot open the app after so many tries. This makes it harder to do a transfer. Please resolve the problem faster. Thank you.
Transaction error error error error error non stop. Seriously noob, super useless especially TAC, making functional apps and services super trash. Just fired whoever team that development this apps.
The worst worst worst worst bank apps ever!!!!!! Take forever to load even though the wifi signal is good.. The web server is better than this stupid apps!!! But the web server is not that good also!!!!
I hardly login to this apps nowadays..It keeps loading,showing the circling icon everytime when ever I try to open it. Delete and reinstall many times,but the problem still the same..If this keep happens, I wont be able to use my Bimb online services since it is required to be approved from this apps, and it is so troublesome.
The worst banking app in Malaysia I've used. Everything loads up very poorly. You want to pay some stuff at the store using qr? Well, you'd die of old age first. Even the Bank Islam website sucks. People that uses this intentionally are masochists.
Supposed to be, an app make things easier. But this apps make things harder. Everytime I downloaded it, I need to key in the data like I'm a totally new user. Although I re-install it on the same device. Worst experience is today. When it magically TOTALLY log out. And when I try to login, it told me to key in data like I'm a new user. Need to re-setup qr pay. Need to key in IC number. The same app that has been running quite a few times before this on the same device. Deserve 0 star I think.
After the new update version, I cant log in as the notifications keep on saying "unable to connect to the server" which is very hassle and time consuming to deal with. Very disappointed with the buggy apps and it doesnt seem helpful at all. Not sure if this happens to android users only or not.
Very very very poor online bank service. Have to try sooo many times before your transaction success using this apps. Please improve your poor service guys.
Apps got lots of prob during startup. Reinstall and its gna deauthorize ir registered phone when all u want is to use back. Trash quality.
Bad interface and the worst of all, the line and the online services of the app is barely bearable at most. 0 star.
The apps took time for every process even log in also take too long . Very dissapointed . Sometime its very hard to make money transfer 👎
What happen to this app, it took more time to open it, sometime it waste my time to wait just to transfer the money but in the end i could't.
Fix the bugs and improve the server.
Been using the apps but lately the apps become suck. Super snail and giving a fuss to the customers. Please do something fast or ur going to loose a lot of customers
Apps selalu error. So bila nak transfer, guna biz online, tapi tetap perlu approval dari apps ni yg langsung tak boleh buka. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bank islam should remain with web saja. No need app. Youre not ready to use app bila selalu error. Menyusahkan user.
Very disappointed with the apps. Take very long time to login and even cant doo fpx transaction. This app should make life easier with cashless payment nowadays.
The Go app sooo slow n not responsive in good time. Its take too long for app to activate..its not help for urgent matter when to used it.
I can't open up the apps .. how i'm gonna make transaction? 😭 i already update to the latest One
When we r already at the cashier and the apps dont even work. There and then we tried to uninstal n reinstal.. but sometimes it wont work also after reinstall 🥲
Slow , Cannot do any transfactions. Then its better after the comments
unresponsive. very slow. give you good hard headache .
Till still dont have any updated. I cant even open my app. Why your system is too bad? Please solve this problem! Why have update when is causing more trouble to user!
It is definitely the slowest bank application in Malaysia. I have Maybank, Standard Chartered, Public Bank, UOB, Alliance, OCBC application in my phone. Bank Islam easily the winner in this category. Keep up the good work although I highly doubt that any other bank will be able to defeat you in term of buggy and laggy.
Worst bank app. Slow and always not responsive. Please, I BEG of you, please, make development for this app. Make it function as good as other bank apps.
Please upgrade your online banking system.There is always a problem when users want to log in and always use the excuse that your internet line is problematic but in fact it is not.Please take action as soon as possible because many users want to use it to pay all commitments.Thank you
cannot open the app after the update. Should fix this as it keep on loading for a long time.It still cannot open up to 3 days until now.
So slow to open this app, hopefully this problem will be solve in tge future.
Frequently lags. Loading to log in page very slow. Overall not very secure.
App Server always shows a slow as a snail app's navigation. Kindly check the server in case of hacker intrusion.
Very bad apps. The loading time is so long & it's really not convenient to use it compared to website. If you want to develop an apps make sure it is user friendly and very dissatisfied with this apps. Every transaction is very difficult and make your worry whether it is already successful to be transfer or not. Please make a change. Thank you.
I cannot open the app since I downloaded the new version. It kept showing the Unable to Connect to Server box everytime I open the app. I have been using it for 2 years and it got its up and down, but this time is the worst. And since everything needed to be aunthenticate using the Go app, found it very inconvenient and a huge hassle. Please do something about it. Thank you.
This app is extremely terrible, shame on the developers for not fixing it. Might as well use other alternatives than this slowpoke.
The login part kinda slow while waiting for loading. Sometimes, it freezes and crashed.
Always need updated. Every transaction need approval by secure site (this case, by Bank Islam Go)..but pending and buffer too much. Not user friendly...
Slow, lag and not user friendly
Very bad IB apps. Always shows error even though it has been updated to the latest. Please do something for the customers or else Bank Islam IB will always receive bad reviews.
Slow and laggy..almost every time cant sign in..need to relaunch the app several times.. tonight issue "cant connect to server".
After I put id, password, ic, I waited for a long time to get IAC number but it didn't send it to my mobile number! It's so annoying app!
"unable to connect to server" this problem has occurred few months now. very troublesome. edit : after reinstall this app, I finally can use it as before. BUT, the loading screen before entering the password took FOREVER 😢 if any of you having the same issue, and you are reading this, please clear the app's cache. it makes the app smoother
Loading slow, cant do transaction without it. So much for security when u cant even do a simple transaction
Love this apps. Easy and convenience to access. Go Bank Islam dah BETTER. Alhamdulillah.
PLEASE HIRE BETTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPER. CUSTOMER CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE. SLOW SLOW SLOW, MAINTENANCE ALL THE WAY. SOMETIMES FUNCTION CAN'T BE USED. REBOOT THIS APP PLEASE.
The apps is getting worse day by day. Been waiting for more than 10 mins just to get in...and sometimes didn't even get to log in.
This app is getting worsen day by day, super slow and laggy and not advanced like other banks apps. Please improve your apps service.
Your rating now 1.3..only 1 star..probably ending with no star if playstore allow us... each time update your apps keep freezing... stuck at loading page..do something.. look at your competitor..maybank..cimb...all good
Previous version is better..i cannot see my balance in TH after the update
Bad experience.. alway lag and have lots of problem especially on QR Code and scanning.. why even develop this app if you have no intention to maintain it?
to slow connection..fail..upset...more complicated
This app is really slow, maybe because of the server. Really need to upgrade the responds time for the sistem.
It's fine when it works, but right now it doesn't work more often than it does. Which is a problem since BIMB is now forcing their clients to use this app for transaction approvals. When you want to do that, then the app needs to be reliable, which this app is obviously not. It's taken me several tries and I still can't transfer my money.
Please la... So slow when open the apps, for 30+ min only "pusing-pusing". And please consider to bring back TAC since you apps can't even open to authorize my purchase
The GO secure function is really frustrating. Always didn't work in crucial time. Please do something with your apps.
New update problem. This app stuck at asking me to accept / reject payment. But I did not do any payment. Please repair the problem.
Worst app ever, unable to log in around pay day week 25th until end of month for every month. Really difficult to make any online transaction during this period.
Cannot scan qr from gallery..i already have latest version on my one plus 11
Worst ever, cannot check available balance at all. Any banking payment also lag and too slow. What happen????
da update.. tapi apa yg lambat sgt nk bukaknya..yg lama lagi better than new veraion.. take so long to. open.. disappointed betul dgn isu apps bank islam ni
This app keep loading everytime we try to use it. It really annoying since every online transaction need to be verified by this app.
Loading too long, access denied, then say i had logged in, cant even open in web, clear data and force stop then working, this apps clearly is broken.
Update in April 2023 It's becoming worse. I can't even open the app even after reinstalling it after clear history, cache and reset phone. Recent update is causing problems to open the app. I am unable to use it completely. It take ages to open as well as use the GO verification. I uninstalled, clear cache multiple times with wifi and data connection without any success. I am sure the problem comes from the app itself.
This is most worst bank app in Malaysia. I wonder why Uitm compulsory for student to use Bank Islam as main student bank account?. App very slow, always show loading bubble, I'm unable to log in to app. Bank Islam you are multimillion company, you are supposedly able to upgrade and fix app without problem. New update: I'm done!!!. Time to close Bank Islam account or let's account became dormant. I'm suggest user closed account and change to Maybank MAE and Cimb Octo or transfer to TNG E-wallet.
Bank islam banking app is the slowest and the worst . Server always doesnt work. Imagine trying to pay using the app and u just stare at the loading white page for 30 minutes
I hv tried mny times to pay my bills last few days but never can log in go apps. U shud provide alternative. So disappointing.
Unable to do fund transfer. Keep getting error code. The basic function of transferring money is not properly develop.
Why i cannot check my Tabung Haji account? The apps already update latest version 10. Please assist
I've updated this app and I've lost RM13 once I logged in. Have been checked the transaction history and didn't know where it goes. I still remember the balance in my account. Plus, I just went to ATM a week ago. The amount is still fresh in my head. Got the receipt too. I'm truly disappointed and can no longer trust it. What if losing large amount of money after this? It's scary. I guess I should uninstall this app :( it's no longer secure for me
Why always loading, take to long loading, sign out suddenly, need to uninstall and install back and came out with box that stated i need to performed transaction to TH, DUIT NOW AND OTHERS AFTER 12 HOURS.
I keep on getting 'unable to connect to server' issues and sometimes had to reinstall the apps due to crash and all. Is there any explanation to this? Issues like this have made it so difficult for me to make a transaction especially on important one. So, I'm truly disappointed. I hope you all can fix this. It hindred people's business and matter. Also, why does the app won't allow screenshot? Sometimes, I forgot to share my receipt and try to find back my transaction record but can't screenshot
Please fix... keep getting error exceeded daily limit when making transaction. Need to switch using browser instead, such a hassle...
The apps keeps crashing even i uninstall it. My id also cannot be detected. Why it keeps on loading????
Very disturbing.. every transactions becomes hard due to error of system. It takes time and not efficient at àll. Please update ur service at it is very slow and not working. The service is still not working despite having reinstalled a few times. Saying that I haven't registered though just send me verification of successful register.!!???
Worst banking apps. Keep loading although internet line is good. Unable to access the app for online transactions. Please improve
After the update, the app keep crashing and pop up said "server error, unable to connect to server". This has been going for weeks and I can't use duitnow for most of my purchases and transfer which is frustrating. Why the update bring down the app instead of "fixing the bug" like the update state. I'm mortified and scared at the thought my account can be easily hacked while the app crashing.
Much more worst. I cannot login to my acc and usually if i want to login, it always pop out 'high volume of traffic.' what-
why need to relaunch the app for confirmation in online transaction, seriously then it stuck just loading forever. please fix asap ! edit : if i can give 0 star i will give it, have been use for a long time and theres no imrprovement in this app, what are you doing? cant this app be like other bangking app?
Forced to stay hungry the whole day without money because app is down & online banking down, and contactless card transaction cannot be used. I really hate this bank.
Looking forward for better online service. This apps too slow for loading and frequent error issue on server.
too slow and laggy. sometimes need to wait for a long time to login. when to approve transaction even took a long time. please improve tremendously your app bank islam.
Every time update new version. Making it more complicated in all ways. Fingerprint can't access, face recognition take times, need 2 times key in password, auto log out, buffering at all the time until i sleep and wake up on the next day and still buffering. Neither use android or ios, the experience of using is still the same, getting worse.
The worst banking apps... Always loading for so long. Had to do everything in website since the apps is always having prob.
App paling useless. Susah nk access, loading then lastly tak boleh nk buka pun.
Too slow to load in login page. I want to use urgently QR Pay yesterday.
i think no star for this application. very bad. so stress use this. take so long time to open. difficult to transfer/payment. waste time!!
Slow and this app should be optional, not users need to download your app just to use your services. Make it optional.
Worse bank app ever. Can't event log in. Take so much time to load around 5-10 minutes. Pls fix. I'm a student so it's hard for me to pay some stuff
App keeps getting crash and error for login. Please please fix this. Even nak bukak online punya kt website pun slow sangat ya. Do something to fix this asap.
Ever since the Error 500 appeared, the app collapsed and unable to be open. Tried deleting cache, data, force stop it but nothing works. I wanted to do simple transactions using DuitNow but I can't. Uninstalling and reinstalling is a lot of work because you have to setup your account back.
Why remove the option to make transactions using the website? Seems like another unnecessary application that you must download for basic banking service. At least give us a choice!
It has been almost a week i cant access to my account. Last week was due to huge traffic. Today, unable to connect to server.
Please fix this app. It is annoying when you need to transfer money urgently but this app takes tooooooo longgggg loading. Very bad app.
Really slow. I can't stress this enough. My patience is running even thinner every time I need to use this app. Why we need to authorise from the app when the app is this slow? I looked at your replies to the other users and they're just the same things being said over and over again. It really shows that you don't care about us. I already cleared the cache and uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but still can't even log in. I've done the best that I can, so why can't you guys do the same?
Super slow, super clunky, super inefficient
Bad..Cannot even open the app..many times say 'Currently under maintenance'. Hard to do transactions. Please fix the issue.
I cant open this apps after update!!!previous better than this!!! Fix it!!!
Unable to install ..only able to open using playstore then problem to do transfer ..I think this is worst app ever then other bank ...please do something
Very slow app, it take a long time just to open the app and most of the time i cannot access the app at all.
Deserves no star. The worst app for a bank. Loading too long. Always lag and crash. Serioulsly this app needs improvements
Where is the menu to view transaction signing? Adding or deleting favorite accounts has become difficult! If you click on the Transaction Signing notification bar while using the apps, it won't redirect to the correct page to approve the transaction. And there is no way to view the current Transaction Signing! Inbox messages cannot be clicked too! Disappointing! This apps is only good to view the current balance, that's all!
Among the dumbest feature with this apps is they didnt let me screen shot due to privacy policy THIS JUST REALLY EXTREMELY BOTHERING ME, I CANT SHARE MY PAYMENT PROOF BECAUSE I FORGOT TO SHARE THE PDF FILE AFTER I PAID MY SELLER AND I PROCEED TO HOME SCREEN END UP CANT TAKE SCREENSHOT ANYWHERE WITHIN THE APPS? WHY CIMB APPS DIDNT DO THIS? SO WHY WOULD YOU?
Can't login since yesterday. Already updated the app. 🤬
why this apps can't screenshot.. I can't give any proof too seller when i buy some thing when transfer the money. and this app always hank, then must uninstall n reinstall again n again..
No star for a bad apps. Im 1st time want to register. Cannot open at all and just appeared server error!!
Hello, I can't open my apps to check my account. It just said server error. Even the website can't be open. Please fix it.
I can't log-in to the app using my new phone. I have been installing and uninstalling the app for many time but the problem keep on going. Whenever I try to log-in, the app suddenly close. Like when i fill up my bank id and it started loading then the app close and it went back to my phone homepage. I tried many time and I nearly reach to the final step, but it still suddenly close. Please solve this problem quickly cause it is inconvenience to make a transactions thru the website. Thank you.
Always load for a very long time especially when I'm trying to make transaction causing the transaction to be cancelled.
one of the worse performing online banking app with multiple downtimes and bugs
Worst. Always encountered Server Error Unable to connect to the server. What should I do then???
After i updated, i cnnot log into the app anymore!
Makin Update, Makin teruk. Kena clear data storage setiap kali nak launch app ni...
Loading screen took so long and keep getting error message . Sometime biometric also cannot use .
A very unreliable piece of technology. Takes forever to go to login page, and sometimes even fail. I have to clear cache and storage then reopen to see the login page. To transfer money, the bank require the GO authorization but when you cannot even open the app and login this will make it useless. I suggest to first remove the need for GO authorization and stick to 6 digit codes until you guys fix the issues for your app. 1 star review overall is not a very good look for the brand. Best of luck
Cant open the app, it stuck on loading screen
Dear developer, This app always stuck on login. When log in to app, I cannot log in to other browser. I want transfer my money to pay for the thing i buy. Fix this god dam stupit mf apps lah weh. Learn from MAE, CIMB Click and others.. Developer lena ka..
Fix this app at least please. Cannot take screenshot for proof of payment. And loading , took forever. Apps is not so friendly user.
Need to approve transaction in app, app forever loading. At least give option for sms code for fak sake. Might actually change bank just because of this app
Please fixed this apps, it was not stable sometimes I can login using fingerprint sometime its cannot..if I can put 1/2 star ..that is your rating I can give to your app
Been using this app for years and it was smooth. But after recent update, it just went from good to worst! Whenever i tried to login, keep on pop-up 'unable to reach server'. Super annoying! Then i uninstall and re-install, looks fine but when i keyin my ic number, it detect as error. U guys please fix it asap.
By far the worst banking app. Always auto logged out due to the server issue. And to login will require few attempts which is ridiculous. The UI is bery basic and sometimes a bit confusing for example hard to notice which one is required field. Why don't you just suggest to re-install the app? BIMB User. Person_A: can just transfer me the money. Me: Great! Lemme uninstall and install this wonderful banking app.
problem app,i cannot open the apps for swveral times
Such a nuisance/ problematic/ inconvenient apps..need to do transaction asap, but not able to open apps or even online banking..what a turndown..improve la bank islam
I don't know what's wrong with Bank Islam app anymore. Previous version is more stable, easy and user-friendly. And now? Double menyusahkan users.
0.5 star if i can put here. The worst apps for banking. I cant even open the apps properly to accept the transaction. Just keep the tac style laa, dont copy other banking apps. Haiyaaa!
The worst online banking apps Ive used. It took forever just to load. Then another forever to load any payment methods.
Better than Road Runner . Just imigine.
The function of this apps make so difficult to transfer my money to make payment for my car n my grab n all my apps.. Why this apps took so long to loading. 2 days waiting n still loading.. Do something bnk islam why so weak
Shouldn't have given a star. First of all this is inconvenient at all. The website is much more better. I'm trying to do a single transaction over days but still can't. Go to 'Go secure' put in the digits still NOTHING. The needs to log in everytime and then the apps log out suddenly when making transaction so irritating. Plus the 'not valid' when literally just a second after log in. A single transaction but this much troubles is so frustrating. It's making me lost temper everytime.
Very bad. App is not working. Even after update. Any other way to do online transfer now?
I have been using the app for more than a year (maybe) and there have been massive improvements, kudos to the developers 👍🏻 I'm looking forward to future improvements especially in these 3 aspects - a more friendlier GUI (not too robot-ish please), a more complete/comprehensive transfer experience and frequent updates to fix the bugs. Additionally I have a question, the ability to add fav transfers is actually also not available on other banking apps, is it for security reasons?
I want to transfer money urgently but they asked to download the go bank apps. The darn app cannot even be accessed. Failed to connect to server. Wth
This is the worst app ever. I can't even tap go secure how do I want to transfer for online banking, this is so annoying
Worst app, always loading and high volume traffic. Need approvement and be like a maybank app easier to people. Go to online banking site also same.
The app suddenly cannot open , it say server error.. Already tried to uninstall and install back but still same. Why ahhh ayoooooooooo
System always down .. very hard to make online transaction . if this have ZERO star , i will rate this . Its been years !
Almost there with BSN with the most inefficient banking service in Malaysia. Useless apps / online platform every end of the month
Cant even access the apps..transfer through website but it to go to the apps to be able to transfer..but everytime i want to access cant even enter the apps..the apps always problem..
Pleaseeeeee update the app to be faster.I am really annoyed using this app.the login session itself took about more than one minute.please change your technical team or hire the better new team ASAP!
Apps are so slow and annoying. I keep getting access denied. Please improve it.
This app does not deserve even one star. Keep loading until forever cannot be used, always in high traffic issue.
not a good bank app. Loading for very long time. Got problem when to buy stuff on shopee & when i want to topup my internet. I can't take it anymore
Wouldn't even give this app a single star if I could. You forced us to use this app for such security reason but didn't even manage to even come with a good apps. Please do some quick improvements
The previous version is better. The current app is so slow and annoying. Please fix this ASAP!
The server always got error, please fix it! I can't even log in to my account because of that!
The apps is definitely less convenient than the website. But, nothing out of expectation. Because depending on the data you use the loading time of the apps may be slower or faster. Sometimes cannot use it because it was under maintenance but definitely not because of the apps itself if unable to use it. It also depends on your phone specs and storage. 😉
Getting worst day by day.Make it verify on the app after using the web for transaction.But the app was not working properly and immidiate urgent transaction all getting delay.
CAN'T USE AT ALL. LOADING FOR A LONG TIME THEN ERROR. TRIED UNINSTALL THEN REINSTALL BUT SAME RESULT. ITS BEEN ALMOST A WEEK. PLEASE FIX IT IMMEDIATELY. THANK YOU. IM A LONG-TIME USER
This app make me spoil to do on9 transaction still cannot use and so bad to me,ples take action to solve this problem ASAP to give and make excellent app for easy to use tq
Now can't even open app. Keeps saying high volume of traffic and tell us to try again later. EPIC FAIL
Slow n loading. Apa punya app laaaa. Buatla sesuatu.
Please improve service quality.. cannot be relied upon much needed.. it suck... The worse apps ever.. Do you guys don't have the person that can handle this ke . Shame lah .. Bank lain ada apps, bank hang pun nak buat apps .. buat lah betul betul.. buat kerja dengan kaki ke?
Please do fix your app. I been try to open the app to pay via QR. Its been 2 hours trying to open it. Still fail to do so. Soo emberassing when want to buy something and pay using QR.
We were forced to use this app for our online transactions. But this app caused alot of problem. Server error. Cant connect to the server. Etc. Please Bank Islam don't so unprofessional. Dont cause your customers alot problems. Must I keep on unistalling and then reinstalling again to use your app? People complained but its look as if there is still no improvement. The customers still have had difficulties to use this app. So frustrated
This bank app is by far the worst. It's very slow to load, at least 2 mins at the loading screen. I am not exaggerating! Crashes all the time. Verification details sometimes doesn't appear. Seriously, how does a relatively big bank have such an app? I sincerely hope a major improvement is done soon!
Why won't you take action eventho you have 1.2 ratings? Is user satisfaction not important? This app take too much times to load that makes it harder for any transaction especially after 'go secure' features. If you made an app that is this slow you should just use TAC number. Don't bother request for a rating if your company don't take action at all.
VERY BAD experience. The switching between the acc is so not user-friendly. And now I have a problem to access my company acc because of "invalid credential". I need an urgent transfer and now THIS. If you want to make every transfer more secure by doing this, please make sure the app is good-enough. I hope to see the improvements. Pleasseee...
I cannot access this app as the app unable to connect with the server. I hope this thing can be settle asap.
Terrible! Worst online banking I've ever had. Kasi tutup sajalah app!
The app is soo buggy. It just keep on loading after opening the app. If it didn't stuck loading, it will take a few minutes for it to finish loading and show the login screen. What's the point of having an app if it much more of a hassle to use. By far the most horrible banking app i ever used.
Please improve your user experience. App cannot open and cannot approve any transaction. What is the point of having the app if cannot be open
many times unable to load and log in . bank islam please upgrade your services apps
Everytime nak guna, had to wait flipping long time, the berudu keep spinning infinitely. Please improve BIMB
Not recommended tbh. After the recent update, it logged me off and I had to re-register into the app and it crashed after inputting the security code. Many. Times. There's also instances where it kept having issues even before this. And here I thought the octopus app is bad, but this is next level of terrible.
Dah uninstall, lepas tu install balik but still tak boleh bukak pun apps. Bad services.
Sehari semalam dah cuba log in. Asyik loading jaaaaaaa. I dont know when will this apps function well. Always unable to log in. Worst bank apps ever.
very bad experience. after a year uninstalled this app, still no improvement. teruk sangat, please improve lah!!!!!!
The worst app ever..i got the same issue with others..this app became very bad, take time to log in and slow than before..
It's been a week now and the app can't be opened at all. I can't even log in the system. Please fix this issue ASAP
What wrong with your apps recently? After updating the system suddenly i cannot open it at all?!?! Fix it faster please. This issue have not being fixed even after more than 1 week. Dissapointing. It have been very convenient to use it past few years but not anymore. I can't even open it now!
An annoying incompetent app. I can't even get to the log in page, it just keeps on uselessly loading for eternity. The most infuriating thing is that every transaction needs GO authorization, so I'm just here unable to pay my student debt for months. If you're going to make it so important at least make it usable at the very least. FIX IT.
To much buffering. Server need to be upgrade to ensure system running smooth. Nak transfer duit pun payah. Kalau server down notify la customer. Bukan duduk diam je. Ni every hour nak try login utk access tp error sama je. Takkan notify pun ego juga.
Terrible. It used to be the most handy app for transactions. Now i can't even get through the login page. What happened BIMB?? Apps are supposed to make online banking easier but this is the other way around. It has been going on for months now eversince the most recent update. Would very much appreciate if your team can find the problem and fix it asap!
Always have bug n need to be updated.so annoying
Why so much problem lately with Bank Islam apps? Can't even authorize payment and error pops APZ_TSN_0001 transaction is expired (when it is not)
Bad and terrible. The most annoying baking app ever. U don't understand how it can be worser than it was already is. The loading takes far too long and then suddenly cannot login anymore. The go secure is not available to approve anything, can't even click and always error.
Can i know how long you are making this app to loading.. I'm waiting for a long time to open this application.. Please make it faster to open or don't have any loading app
Worse experience of all banking app. Please make good old times TAC than using fully method GO app. I can't even launching the app
What is the purpose to force your customers to use unstable application service? It's very hard to open the application and how will it looks for us when we need to pay instant in front of a counter? Is this another type of promoting method for encourage your customers to change bank?
Takes forever to load the Ui, fingerprint login failed most of the time, lots of server errors and incomplete displayed infos. *Using a good phone w high speed data and more than decent urban speed, screen sensor works in every other app enabled fingerprint access. So, IT'S THE APP & SERVER. And....did the switch off on phone,clear cache, reset data, uninstall reinstall stuffs. So..Yeah.
Worse experience with new version apps. Bank islam take very long time to solve the apps problems. Very disappointed 😔
It's been two weeks since the latest update and the same problem hasnt been solved, 'unable to connect to server', unable to log in. The only solution that they can provide is 'please reinstall', 'please use the lastest version' as if we havent done it before. Very disappointing. Would rate a zero if I could.
very incredibly slow ive never seen an app this slow fix it even with good internet connection it keeps lagging and takes forever to load
I am okay with the Apps, it is easy to use and I have no issue of logging into the Apps. The only problem that I encountered is receiving the IAC. I have to request new IAC at least twice everytime when performing online transactions (it took me longer time to complete just a transfer). Please advise. Thanks.
App paling mudah nak pakai... Sometime problem.. Tp masih better than others
Worst banking apps. Changing transaction limit should not take too long to be effective. Lol
Not supposed to be any star. The worst app ever. Not user friendly, not worth having it. I can't even make any transaction via online or the app. If not 'no service' its either 'error' for whatever reason. Worst of all it say session exp. Like what the F!! I just open the thing like few seconds ago. Keep logout for no reason too. It was easier before if I need to pay immediately or for emergency now it take almost a whole day just to make 1 transaction.
Just to login need a lot time of waiting. How to make transaction with this kind of problem. Make thing more complicated
I thought making an app should ease the users, not make it more difficult. Its annoying that every time the app has an issue need to uninstall and reinstall back app or update it, and bimb doesn't send notification on updates of the app or app issue so its really hard to know what's the problem. The website page is much more easier to use compare to the app.
Apps paling slow antara online banking . Please upgrade. Penat nk tnggu loading
I have to give two stars only as for now the transactions that can only be use in the app confirmation to do any transactions online like buying from Shopee and it take a lot of time for user to be able to do that stuff then before that more faster which is using an old way which is receiving the TAC code. It also take a lot of attempts to make the transactions successfully completed. I hope Bank Islam can improve this con/problem as fast as it could. That all from me. Thank you.
Improved a lot but still can improve for better.
Why can't take the screenshot? I tried to take a few screenshots but still can't..
Worse, app loading very slow.. money transfer also late. Sometimes i pay double just because this app very slow
It was easy navigation & functioning really good before, but now just to log in I have to try 3-4 times, then after log in, to do transaction also it keeps on loading until the session expired. Is it safe anymore. Please do something, before I change my banks. Dont ask me to make a report again, just read this & do something quick. Bank should be reliable & secure!!
For the 4th time I'm writing this review until the dev team can fix the bug. So here goes, I got stucked at the loading screen even when I'm connected to the internet. After loading, it goes to the 'good afternoon' page, it was a blank page, no button or whatsoever, got stucked there. Uninstall the app and installed it again, same thing happened. I can conclude this app is non functinal and utterly useless. Step up your game and learn from MAE ;)
Stuck at login page and never got through. Been having the problem for the last 2 months. After the new update, it gets worse. Now, could never use the app, have to use the browser version. In process of transferring all my funds into another bank, because their app dont give me this kind of problem. Thanks.
You guys need to do something about this app. It keeps crashing, no matter how many times reinstall the app. This is one of the most important channel to do transactions, yet it happens to be so lagged, not responsive and keep popping error. Afraid that u r losing customers, sir.
After update the latest version the app doesn't open at all & not supporting. Once the app open, it automatically close it by itself. It's vry difficult to perform any transactions & need to use chrome or desktop. The problem has been continued for more than 3 weeks. Regretting for updating the latest version😒
the survey always have a problem, always be dragging my time, always crashing like everytime i wanna make a payment, what do you guys even doing? by just keep updating the app but the app are stil the same with the old problems? what a waste of time. All of the reviews from the users have been stating the same problem but nothing changed. Do your work properly by fixing the bug and so on. My connection doesn't have a problem but the app are just horrible. Do what you need to do. PLEASE FIX THIS
So far so good. Maybe take a look into the back button function, it's better to not directly logout, just instead go back to the previous screen. Same as most of users, the biometric login doesn't work. And when will the DuitNow will be integrate into the GO app? Much easier to transfer money if it is available.
Although to the internet connection is strong the apps remain weak as usual. It will take at least 15 minutes most of the time use the apps services. Sometimes to even open the apps it will take too much time. Hopefully, this can be resolved quickly as it will waste a lot of time especially for those who were in rush because of their jobs or important matter.
The app was superb but not anymore. The last update really messed this app up. It has been a week or more since it can be accessed. Now, it keeps telling server error every time the app is opened. I don't see any immediate fixed on this one ever since. Very disappointed. I'm giving one star for now.
The worst bank that I have used ever. 1. When open the bank app, it shows loading icon for 2-3 minutes before enter into the next page. 2. Many times when I do online transaction, Go secured does not respond or announce "transaction failed" etc... has always wasted my time & energy to try to uninstall & reinstall then re-login 3. Stupid main page that shows the account balance BIG & BOLD, which make has no sense of privacy at all.
This is the worst banking app I have ever used. Lately it has been almost useless. Takes ages to to work, not to mention the endless moments of frustration when it displays 'high traffic volume', among others. At shop checkout I often keep other customers waiting while waiting for the app to work, if at all . What a shame for a bank. With the all the bad reviews I don't see the problems solved. Please don't keep telling users to clear cache or what not...I am sure they do that all the time.
Update, it is getting worse, I cant access my account at all. When I logged in it just load then straight up logged me out. I cant access my account at all and the "Server Error" keep on popping up. This app should make it easier for me to transfer money etc but now, I have to use the website. This happens after I updated the app.
Since the start of my usage of GO, I realise the loading time has always been very slow. Frequently javing server error or simply an error to connect. Its like, almost all cashiers at my local stores would describe to me anyone who uses the white/red app is a bad choice and the yellow or Blue app, is the right choice. MasyaAllah how can this be persistent for almost half a year now. Im sure you all have your Tech team. If the interface has problems, whatabout the security, is it questionable too
App always hang and I need to always reset the ibanking because for some reason, they keep telling me I got the credentials wrong. Resetting password is also another issue and always in circles. End up with the issue not resolved. Overall disappointed with the app, the website is more or less the same as well. Only a matter of time for me to close my BIMB account.
App is very slow. Most of the time I can't even log into the app as it just keeps on loading for a very long time. Don't tell me to clear cache, clear storage, reinstall bla bla bla. I'VE TRIED AND IT JUST DOESN'T WORK. Very frustrating. This problem has been going on since last year. Seems to me like they didn't want to take initiative to fix the issue.
The apps become useless if you are in need-to-hurry situation. It takes so much time to load the first page before can use the service. A lot of time, its faster to open browser and go to the site compare to using the apps itself. Then, it defeats the purpose of having the apps in the first place.
Why is it that everytime on salary day, I can't open the app? I had to uninstall & install again. It just get annoying because I need to set up again from the start. The app itself is easy too use, so i wish this would be resolved quickly. Edit (3 May): The developer response to my email regarding my issue pretty quickly, even tho I email them late at night... So, kudos. Improve my rating. Still cannot actually give 5 star la cuz still not perfect.
Always problem when open...buffering until forever
The app is slow and always loading and failed to enter. Everytime i want to make transaction, i need to uninstall and reinstall the app. Can you do something about this? It's such a hassle to uninstall and reinstall every single time when i need to do transaction. Update based on reply by admin : I have never experience this problem with other bank app. I don't have to clear cache to enter any other bank app.
Since the new update, opening the apps is impossible. Always gets stuck at the log in page. Have uninstalled and installed so many times, but the issue of being stuck at log in page is still the same. It makes it difficult to use the GO app to make payments or transactions.
Garbage app, keep getting "Server Error, unable to connect". The website was working fine before and now you need the app to approve duitnow transfers. Why fix thing that was not broken? When you are able to actually access your account, navigation within the app is also sluggish and slow. It takes forever to just do a simple transfer. Seriously considering closing my bank islam account and migrate to a better service.
Why the app is so slow? When I opened the app, the loading animation will play like forever. Can't access the app at all. I have already cleared the cache, I have cleared the data, didn't work. I have uninstalled and installed the app again, worked but only the first time login. Next time I want to login this thing happened again. The app used to work properly now what happened? It has been like this since middle of last year. Were there no fix?
I can't log-in to the app using my phone. I have been installing an uninstalling the app for many time but the problem keep on going. I try to log-in the app suddenly close. I tried to many time and i nearly reach to the final step, but its suddenly close. Please solve the problem quickly. Thank you.
Been using this app over a year. While it has it's drawbacks over its competitors, GO is definitely an upgrade over the old system where you need to access your account from your browser. The app's responsiveness is a bit lacking but overall it achieved its basic functionality.
Very poor apps. Once installed, tried to sign in a few times. Each time it says server problem. Finally was able to sign in. But the balance shown is zero which is impossible coz the would definitely ask me to close the account. Tried again later. Same thing. Zero balance. So decided to uninstall. Please look at other banks app especially maybank. It's much more friendlier.
Please do something, it's not easy to log in, sometimes can, at some times cannot. Already done the clear cache step n using mobile network, reinstall a few times n it's still the same. It's very annoying as we need to use apps for higher amount transaction. Why bother update the apps when the previous version is much better??
Always unable to access the system due to server error or unable to connect to server. I have tried almost everything including switching from data to wifi, but still not working. The app is very inconvenient. Please do something about it.
UX is good enough but need some improvement. Eg, the fingerprint approval for duit now. After logged in to the system with finger print must have approval again but of on main menu no need. Wierd isn't it? Overall, the app was good but feels unpolished and inconsistent. Maybe can ask for more budget for app development next time. If development is on the way then can wait to try.
Cannot log in the apps since day 1 after set up. Install and uninstall few times also. Logging in always error "APZ_TSN_0003" came up. Tried both Mykad / IC number with and without dash "-" but still unable to log in. Tried using home secured wifi as well as phone own internet data but not successful - same error code number came up. Not sure how to rate this apps. However , using the same usename, same password for internet banking - works fine and able to perform all transaction needed.
Please fix your apps! I'm getting difficulties to view the accounts. If let say the network is unstable and the apps lost connection, User not able to logout. When I re-login again, looks like I need to wait for another 24 hours!!!! Open account with you wasting my time. Poor apps services, just like BSN.
I've been having issues logging in since 3weeks now, been reinstalling the apps many times but the same problems keep showed up "couldn't connect to the server" "high network trafficking, too many users" bla3. But even up until today, the app wont fix. It was working perfectly fine before the update, now it has become haywire & I can't do cashless transactions no more. Pls fix the app ASAP developer?!
Oh ya guys, about the "unable to connect to server" problem, i think you guys should uninstall the application, and then install again. I think it worked out for me. I'm not sure if it works for you, but can give it a try ☺️. I saw the notice on the website, i think it supposedly to work like that.
It's not really functional. The fingerprint doesn't work and the app keep getting frozed. I kept installed and reinstalled but still the same. Theres a time that it can be use and there's a time that can't. I have to use the old fashion way which is via web page key in manually to log in. Please take note and fix it as internet banking is very important nowadays.
I don't understand. It's so weird, where this time I updated the app. Later, when I logged in, there's noti pop up saying it needs a change in permission setting which I really don't understand what's that permission for. Previously, it mentioned about accessing my location, which I refused to. Then, my app didn't work.
Very very bad app, sorry Bank Islam but you shouldn't make an app if it's not giving convenience to the users. The problem is not even with the interface but the server itself - very long loading time, easily crashed, can't function properly, can't take high traffic, etc. Please fix it, you're losing users' trust!
This time I had to re install the apps. Once installed I am able to go in and used the apps. But after logging out and tried to re enter, I am unable to go in. It seems that the icon save on phone screen is not responding when I touched it. Sorry no screenshot. Already installed and uninstalled several time.
It's a good app but I hope the developer can link the internet banking history and mobile banking history and make it into one single history list. Plus, I cannot download the receipt of transaction I made. Even there is a download button, it's for all transaction. Not details. Just able to screenshot only.. So, whenever I need to do important/formal transaction I need to open internet banking instead of just use the app.
I can forgive if an app is slow, but this app is downright unusable. App takes forever(literally never ending time) to load and would sometimes crash mid transaction. Hopefully there will be a new version of this app that can go toe to toe with competitors.
It's really frustrating that lately it's taking so damn long to load the app.. at first i though it was a problem with my internet connection but all of my friends that are using this app also experience the same thing.. idk what's wrong with the system but please fix it.. it's hard to use cashless payment method if it's always taking so long to load like this..
Latest system makes my bill payments delay because I need to be logged out for some time before I can log in again in another application. Quite a hasle. If it is for safety reasons, I think your team need to figure out other way around. Not everyone have the leisure to make bills payment on separate occasions.
This app is a fail. Not just it takes too long to load every pages, its not even functioning well. I once make a interbank transfer and the status is pending! I tried again using website and it works fine. So i had to call the customer service to report about it and it took almost a week to get refund. Worst experience ever. I should've stick to using website.
Please upgrade or update your system. System lag and work very slowy even with high speed internet. Very difficult to make online transactions. Mine always has system error and i cannot log into my account. It has been continuing for few month already. Getting security code is also a problem as i was always getting late msg.
After reading several previous previews, I personally endured the same problem which is, unable to log in using the apps. Seems like no improvement to curb the problem. Another issue which I noticed is that using the internet banking method, the steps are confusing. Why can't you simplify ways and methods.
This apps stop working since 1week right when we need most! It keeps showing SERVER ERROR no matter I use WiFi or mobile data! Before that, this apps was not "internet friendly" bcoz it only needs high speed mobile data instead of basic data. However,even I used WiFi still not working and only 1@2 times,I can use after waiting more than 10mins loading!! And now, completely not working! I wish I can give zero star to this apps.
After updating the apps, I cannot log in to my account as the server keep saying unable to connect to the server which is very inconvenient. This is not the first time it happens but almost every time when update the apps. It's not ok as the apps should be more better to user after updating not making it worst. Really sad though.
Always unable to access into this apps with error msg appeared as "due to high traffic". I suppose the bank should be happy and expecting the high traffic as the mark of trust from the user. Please fix it.. to be honest, both apps and website version. I have headache with both today, and customer service always unreachable due to the high numbers of call.
Your app is poorly optimised and not efficient to be used. Apps takes more than a minute to open up. It takes extra minutes just to do a simple transaction. Sometimes, it logout without my consent (While using the app). Please improve and see how other competitors have better mobile apps experience. 🙄 I m complaining because I was forced to use this bank because of my scholar and I don't like the experience so far.
After recent update (date of update release 11/11/2022), the app can't be access at all and it been days, days that it shows "Server error" failure even though my data connection is stable and all. Repeating the step to try again doesn't matter because the same error window keep popping and restrict access into this app. Thankfully your website doesn't crash like this tho but still 🙁
"unable to connect to the server" this thing happen so many time. should repair it immediately or just throw this apps. how many times to clear cache as you said but things happen badly i still cannot login and the same message appear "unable to connect to server". trying to uninstall and reinstall but same problem occur. really dissappointed
The app is always unstable. It took too much time to load and sometimes it couldn't open at all. Please fix it. Things that were supposed to be done easily & quickly will turned out to be a complete disaster. I like to go cashless so I need the app to be available easily all the time
Thing is, I had great difficulty to establish whether this is a legit app or not. I only noticed the previous version was no longer functioning and found this Go app in the Play store. Checked in BIMB website and still no mention of this new app superseding the old one. My advise to BIMB is to be more professional when handling digital content. Make an official announcement in the website about any new digital app or way of handling.
Couldn't log in since about a week ago. Got 'unable to connect to server' error. Tried many times on different days. Same problem. Cleared cache, cleared data, same problem. Uninstalled, reinstalled fresh with the latest version, still couldn't log in. Please advise a solution ASAP as I see many other users facing the same problem. I am using Android.
I've been using this app for 2+ year or so, no problem that really concern me before beside some little bug, but after a several update last year this apps is useless, always loading at the start up screen, now i cannot use duitnow transfer, this happen to me when i'm at supermarket queing to pay my groceries but the apps won't load at all, now i have to go to atm machine to withdraw cash, please fix this problem fast!
Its very frustrating, the system always down, the apps always have problem to scan the qr code or even to log in. Recently, when using the visa card to pay, it deducted twice even the transaction is unsuccessful and it not only happened to me but happen to my other family and friends. Please do better to maintain your customer loyalty
Yesterday I installed it in my phone and it performed well. But today it suddenly freezes out and I can't login to my account. Whenever I've already entered the password and proceeded, it shows my account loged out. I tried to uninstall and install it back but it works the same. I tried using the online banking website and it surprised me by telling that I don't have user account. Today is a Sunday and the branches aren't working, so I would have one day without transactions? What a big trouble!
Having problem to access my acc. The app kept loading and giving notification to use web. But when i tried login through web, it says i am already logged in due to the app despite the app already been closed. Tried to go back to the app, i got access denied! Been in constant loop going back and forth. This is very frustrating! The app got worst upon update.
Couldnt open the apps. Delayed all my tasks. New comments: I noticed that the problem occurs when I use wifi. Once I switched to my mobile data the apps works just fine. Wonder why. I hope the developer can look into this issue. Thanks Another new comments: app asked for udpates. After updates needs to re-register. Continue to fail to register after more than 5 attempts (tries in different days and time, install uninstall, restarting phone). Please, can developer do something about it...
As the apps ALWAYS server error, I decided to use the web instead.. Unfortunately, any online transaction i need to approve via this non-functional app too. In the end, I need to opt for another banking account instead. It's time to terminate my account, i guess. What's the point if the online platform can't be used during this digital era.
13/1/23-Endless loading when i opened the app. Might be because the new update, at least around that time. . . 15/1/23-Work okay so far after reinstall it. For others who did not know, the app only work on single device. In my case, I used the app on multiple device before, and just realise it only can use on one device at a time, this maybe for user security too.
After update the apps, worst and the apps is very hasle and time consuming to deal with. Apps keep crashing and always appear "unable to connect" and take time for login. Feel very dissapointed and frustating to us while using this apps. Each time upgrade it still slow and please ensure the apps is easily convience for us to use.
This app starts to get slower and slower. Can't even share receipt to whatsapp for whatever reason. Whenever i try to scan qr code from my gallery, the app restarts itself and sometimes I can't scan my finger print for faster log in. Even if i do get to scan my finger print, it takes ages to load. I dont know why so please fix this app.
I barely can log in. The LOADİNG was always taking forever! When it does logged in, every single click to proceed with different services will take another LONG LOADİNG and most of the time I got kicked out or the time sessions expired before I could complete them! 😔 Please do fix it or I have no option but use another online banking 🙃!
The transition is a bit slow & login with biometric also slow. I wish that the app will improves the swiftness of transition from one page to another & also, i hope it never neglect user's security in all aspects. Keep on improving.
Salam. I faced the problem in log in. After key in the correct User ID, the apps seems crash and instantly back to phone menu. I do refer to the nearest branch and contact center but they could not give a solution to the problem. They always said to have up to date apps n for sure i did update the apps. The branch officer said mybe my phone the old version phone n the storage was full....hellooooo!!! I dont have any problem with my acc as i still can access via browser but cant do in bimb go.
Website is much more stable to use, and more reliable. Now the server is down, and I don't know why. I like using it to do transfers and DuitNow QR, even checking balance often. Please fix this soon. But the SecureGO is inconvenient, I had a crash once and I cannot approve payment. Maintain the SMS codes for the website, unless the transaction is through the app.
I got kicked out from the apps when I try to log in. And ive been trying for many times. I think it's not just me, everyone else also face the same problem. Please fix this. It's troublesome to use the website but that's the only option since this apps does not works well. Thanks
I cant share the pdf of my transaction, i thought it was just a bug, that will be fixed after an updates, already went through 2 updates but still not fixed? There also no sections for troubleshooting or somewhere that let u ask when u have a problem with the app. The app was fine until i cant download my pdf. Its just too inconvenience to people using the app.
Couldn't log in to this app, and apparently there's update available. Tried to update but pending for hours. So I uninstalled the apps, restart my phone and tried to re-install. But until now it's still pending installation. I don't have any problem updating/installing other apps. So now I don't even have the apps, and have to login in web version
Was working fine until one day it just decided to give up on me. I can't access my account It just gives me a loading screen. I thought reinstalling it might help, but nope. Now it just shows me the Get Started page every time. When I click on it, only blank screen is shown.
Very bad. Everytime open the apps, the system will loading and buffering. In one day this happens quite all the time. Problem is transaction above RM200 needs secure confirmation from the apps but the apps cannot be openned. WORST WORST WORST internet banking apps. Please improve otherwise people will not put money in your saving account.
The performance is really bad. It always dissapointed to open the app as almost all the time it was not function. Already reinstall to many times, but it still same after a few days. Please make it the performance as previous. Previously, it was really easy to access this apps.
I have worst experience with this new updated apps. I already update my phone, my phone is still new. Already clear cache. Already switch to mobile data or wifi but i still experiencing loading error and server error. I dont how to give feedback anymore. Already uninstall and install it back but still doesn't solve the problem that i experienced. You guys have to take this seriusly 😌 if you want to make an apps you have to make sure it user friendly and usable. Dont make us frustrated
Unable to open the apps at all after setting up on the phone. Everytime have to install and reinstall. When i use the website, require the GO aunthentication, but cannot open the apps. Keeps on loading and crashing. Before this the apps is more stable. Please fix this fast. Its so hard to do transaction.
Had problem login with fingerprint, developer responded to reenable the Quick Touch and it works now. On another matter, there's a lot of work to be done if they want to compete with other mobile banking apps but for its current iteration, I think it's quite good.
What is wrong with this app? I've been using bank Islam for a year now but only the previous version worked and not the latest one😡 It kept showing server and stuck on loading screen everytime I opened it! I also uninstall and reinstalled it several times but still not working😡👎🏻 what the heck?(edit: Now it became extremely slow😡 why?! So annoying!!)
Lagging. Takes too long to even open the apps. Even if it's not peak hour or date or whatever. Biometric fingerprint doesn't usually available. An app is supposed to be convenient and efficient. You lack both.
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME! A month & counting, no progressive updates from developer! I've tried everything you asked for, reinstall the apps but nothing works. Quite a shame, overall quite friendly but not really reliable as to date. Please remove the function of verification via Go if you're not addressing this problem yet. Really wish this can be fix ASAP.
What happen? After logged in, always error pop out.. I've been cleared all the cache many times, uninstall everything and start again.. Yet the issue still happening. This is the worst banking apps ever.. Please get your technical team fix this for the convenience of other customer. You should hire a better apps developer team!
The app is not useful at all as it always crashes or keep loading for a long time. The developer is keep stating that they're improving the app but there's no improvement till now. We as a user can't use the app to do any kind of transaction during emergency time also.
I cannot even open the app. I uninstalled and reinstalled multiple time but it's all the same. I cannot open the app. It keeps loading. I cannot do fund transfers because I am told to approve the transaction on the app, but I cannot open the app. This happened too many times. Do something about the app. Or give us an option for the IAC when we want to do fund transfers
The time taken to load the app was too long and its very inconvinient when I try to make transactions using QRpay. Please improve the user experience as it is used by so many people. Or just try to make a whole different app that's better in every way. Looking foward to that.
Copy & paste function is not available. This is one of the most important features need to be added. The UI/UX design also got problem ; the contrast etc. pls look back at the basic principles of design.
Updated the apps few weeks back and now am not able to screenshot my transaction anymore. I get that we can share it, but if I forgot then there's literally no way to just get them anymore from the app. I need to open in browser and screenshot from there. So much work to do and very annoying.
I wanted to fund transfer to another account. But at the very last page, the app doesn't cross check and display the official name of the recipient account? It simply trusts the recipient's name I put whilst trasnferring? It's terribly unreliable and unsafe. Unproffessional and unbelievable.
Ive been using this app for like half a year or so. Everything was fine until last two days, it required an update so i did and suddenly the app started to take a longer time to respond and open. Not only that, after the loading, it crashed. I feel so mad about this because we already in an era where qr code banking is a must but an app which must fulfill the needs does not function well. Im disappointed.
Worst app ever. Its been 2 months i've tried to access the app but connection server error has been appearing. Please get ur server fixed. It is not user friendly at all. I have to keep on going to the bank to do certain transaction which this was suppose to be made on online instead.
It's been more than a month i still could not login into the app even though after i had uninstall and install it back repetitively. The app keeps on showing error all the time which makes it difficult for me to go cashless. Please fix this as soon possible.
Worst banking app ever. Just opening the app your greeted with loading screen with an infinite loading time. After that when you try login your account you will have to wait again with the loading screen. Your lucky if you even manage to log in even twice a day without any problem. The app is slow when just about to do transaction, QR payment ot changing the settings. Reinstall and clearing the cache is obviously not working. So overall worst banking app ever.
Stuck at loading screen, clear cache then ok for a bit but then stuck again. Why do i need to clear cashe every damn time? DuitNow qr will need to reset transfer limit everytime clear cache. Duitnow qr camera is distorted as if the camera is squeezed. Qr detection is garbage, the scanner will show error message when im not even scanning anything, clicking OK on errror pop up will pop up another failed to scan error message. I only use this app to transfer with duitnow and I cant even do that
Worst experience ever. This is my first time downloading this app. I can't log into the app. The app will turn off or kick me out the app after i try to submit my password.. I tried updating my phone and somehow it worked, I can enter the app, but another problem emerge😅. When I use qr code, it says that i dont have any bank account even though i have one. It even suggested me to register my bank account.
So tired.. the apps keep crashing and it's currently unavailable. When they first release the apps, there's minor problem and it's inconvenient to transfer money but the issue is fixed now. But then now the apps keep crashing and I'm a disappointed user
Cant even log in to the app after last update. Keep saying unable to sync cant connect lah apa lah. Very bad. Such a shame because the app itself is good enough. Just the recent unable to log in stuff so if cannot lon in then what use is an app? I see everyone also struggling with this issue not just me. Fix before i change to another bank
Problem after updating the Apps. Before, i'm not having any problem with the app, but yesterday, after updating the apps, pop up 'unable to connect the server' showing up. No matter how frequent i turn off & restart my handphone, it is still the same. It's getting annoying as i need to make money transaction asap. Preferably i don't want to use the website as i want to transfer to other bank immediately. Please....fix this Bank Islam Go.....
I can't even make a proper transaction without the app lagging on the other end. The app used to be good and was easier to login. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app because it said 'unable to connect to server'. I hope this bug will be fixed as soon as possible.
The loading screen took so long. I can't even enter the login page, yet when I tried to login it will took so long to loading results to " We're having bad traffic " pop-up shown multiple times. Very bad app for multi billionaire company, even the beginner devs can do better application than this one.
Whenever I try to open the app, the words 'Unable to connect to server' pops out and I've been disappointed ever since. Why doesn't it work? Well, that's for the team to figure out and for us to wait in anticipation. So it's best if you GO and do it. Get it? GO and do it? No? Ok. Still frustrated with the app tho. 1 star, very bad.
Another hassle. A whole more inconvenient. You think i need more apps in my phone when a browser can do pretty much everything. No instructions how to start and i can't even get past the login page. Give a damned instructions, a simple one so the not so it savvy can do it too.
The worst and stupidest banking app ever. Logging in takes forever and sometimes can't even logged in. Error messages pop up here and there. Super slow make heart boil everytime I use the app. Why bother develop an app when customer can't even have ease of heart using the app. Worst experience. Period!!!
Currently very very annoyed right now. It has been two days! I cant transfer using the app, and if i want to transfer using the web, they ask to get the verification via the app?? U can just ask for tac no! Two days im stuck!!!! Helloooooo i have bills to pay meney to transfer!!! The apps stated "system is currently unavailable, please try later" and proceed to state " the connection is not secured, request cannot be secured" seriously what kind of connection are u referring to???!!!! Fix this
The app gets very buggy starting on November and I'm always stuck at the loading screen (before the login one). I have uninstalled it once and reinstall it again, but still the problem persists. Fix your app Bank Islam if you really want us users to ditch the web version of it. Even the web version I can't get a receipt after any kind of payment
Current update not working. Everytime I enter the apps, a pop up saying server error occured. This has happened since the last update and I have not be able to login using the apps since then. Please fix the current update so that there will be no more inconvenience later.
The apps is too easy to installed and user friendly. In term of security is quite weak. The most bad thing about this app, it's always have unstable connection, i was unable to access it for few days since its failed to connect to server. 🥲🥲
After the update, it took me few minutes to log in. I open other online bank apps and its working fine. So it's not my internet problem. After waiting few minutes to log in, it log out by itself a few seconds after i log in. It's better to log in into their system via chrome or Firefox rather than use their app. It's hard for users to use this app when in hurry. Please fix this issue please ASAP.
This is horrible. I can't access my account. Wanted to make transaction but needed to change transaction limit, that required me to approve the change in the app but I can't even LOGIN. Uninstalled and installed back..high traffic volume pulak. Don't make an app if you can't do decent maintenance.
App always loading after update last week. Stuck at log in page. Dunno wht happen. I uninstalled the app n install back, the problem cannot solved. I've been use this app since last year but this latest update is so unconvinced. The app should be user friendly with high security but this app totally different. Do something please.
This app is useful but I have problem where it cant be open a lot of times. After I open it, it just keep loading. I have to uninstall and install it back everytime this happen. This could probably be the app needing an update but would like dev to prompt it instead of me reinstalling it everytime. Thanks
The systems are really bad , poor & slow. Seriously , slow to access. Please do update/upgrade. Really bad. Even , i can't log in into my own account it keeps loading. Need some improvement for this. Really disappointed. Today , I've topup for my friend my money has been deducted but he haven't received the topup yet , it shows Succesful but NADA. Hope will see changers without clashing. Thank you 😣
Clearing the cache and reinstalling does nothing, I still cannot access the app since the latest update version. And I had no problem with my WiFi connection. Pls revert back to older version if the newer version is not ready.
Everything with this apps or bank seems to be delayed. Fund transfer has been delayed because of weekend as it is IBG, top-up reload has been delayed because of unknown reason. Been waiting like crazy, if I know about this, it must be much faster to just take out the money from the ATM and settle all of my things at once. Installing this to makes life easier, but seems like that's not the case. Very disappointed.
Interface hard to understand. I want to delete my previous fav acc but cant find the button. I want to direct debit into my TH acc. First, I do it on website but restricted and advised I should download GO apps. Try on apps but cant find the page. Hard to navigate. The only easy one is to transfer money. If I want to managed my acc, its hard to done it on apps. Useless
The most buggy app that I had ever encountered. Slow to start, login problem with error "unable to connect to the server". The only reason I had to install this is because the need for verification from the app for fpx payment. PLEASE, just send TAC code to mobile number instead of needing to use this horrible app. New edit : Is the server for this app even up? I kept having issues with "cannot connect to the server". Seriously just get rid of this trash app if so lazy to maintain the app.
1) No way to make transfer to accounts other than favourite account. 2) Furthermore, addition of a favourite account is not possible through the mobile app, there is no relevant selection to authorise the addition even after being directed from the online banking website. Perhaps a more user friendly way to authorise the addition of a fav account is by sending a code to a verified phone number or email address. Please resolve both issues asap as the app is not user friendly at all at this point.
It is so not convenient. Why bother making an apps if I have to go back to website to add fav acc then go back to apps for transfer? The apps should make it able to all acc. And today I tried to make a transaction to my fav acc list but the transaction is pending. Idk. Maybe it is under maintenance or what?? The money already deduct from acc. It just the process is pending. Help me out. Thanks!
Latest update (Jan2022) - I'm having problem on opening the app from the start. It's weird the app ask me to update to the latest version but when I clicked the UPDATE button it jumped to my playstore and it shows no update since I've set it auto-update. Then, I press BACK, the app seems blank and can't use it at all. Please fix this ASAP. This is getting me worried since I have to check my account frequently.
Good for a start, and alhamdulillah finally what I've been waiting for since first I registered for bank islam. Thank you very much to the developers team on doing this. As I've gone through the reviews, the supports and developer are actively communicating back to the users, so that's a star from me. My comments for the interface is, based on my experience, it's better to have that More Options (six dots in the bottom right corner) to be placed alongside the top-up options on the bottom menu.
I never leave a review on Google Play, but this one, I feel obligated to make one. I have to let everyone know that this is the most useless, yet important apps I've ever download in my life! Everytime I need to make a transfer, I need to open this apps for approval. Yet, the apps kept loading endlessly. Thank you for making my life miserable.
We have to reinstall everytime when need to use this app to get the infinite login loading bugs away. This is the worst app for online banking. And no, don't tell us to reinstall or clear cache or any kind of self troubleshoot ever again. Just go fix your bugs already. 🤦🏻‍♀️
Very poor. Really disappointing because couldn't use it when there's an emergency to do the online transaction.. I even can't open the app it's always showing that server error for past few months.. really hoping that you will improve the system asap :⁠-⁠(
The best banking app ever. Why you might ask ? Because even me, myself couldn't get past through the loading screen, even scammers would not even get through this app too, good job, keep everyone out from entering and using the app. Edit : The suggested "Clear Cache" doesn't even help in this case, tq.
I can't see the amount of my savings in the app compared to the website...I can see the amount😭. As a beginner I totally cried a lot that there's no money in it. Then I checked on website...This app aren't user friendly at all. Please fix this😭🙏.As someone who is new to this definitely confusing ad stressful.
I have been experiencing multiple errors and technical issues with your app many times, in almost every transaction I made. Has been happening almost a year plus now. Reading through the reviews by other users, where some had written the same complaints in few year back, it is quite surprising to know that other than admitting the problems and ensuring an improvement to your customer, there is still no positive changes. Do you think this is funny?
What a worse experience using this app. Before it was stable until the recent update makes it super hard to launch app and endless loop of loading time and slow app response. Been thinking to terminate BIMB just for this app is so slow and unresponsive most of the time and I mostly use online banking this is a troublesome for me. So, please fix this app you will lose alot of your customers because of this app alone
Useless... Annoying... Everytime when in urgent need to use this useless apps it will give u hard times. Really useless.
"Rooted device. Can't launch application" What does it means?
every time you want to use, there must be an issue, error traffic too high, or unable to connect to server, app crash end up use browser. The app is getting worse every time it is updated.
Lately I am having a problem with sharing any transaction via WhatsApp. Everytime any transaction, I always click the share button, sent via WhatsApp, transaction statement will be sent with pdf document. Now it fails when I click the share button. There is a statement stating pdf fails to be downloaded. Not sure whether it is my phone settings or the server
I think I saw MANY reviews saying how bad the app is. Especially AFTER pressing UPDATE. Initially it was fine, I like how it's user-friendly. However, the first problem I encounter is I cant use the QR scan by scanning code from gallery. I have to directly scan the code from my friend's phone, or from the shop's counter. THEN, the other day I cant open the app, so it asked me to update. BUT, AFTER UPDATE, it keep saying 'UNABLE TO CONNECT TO SERVER'. Excuse me? App developer? DO YOUR JOB!
This is my 2nd review. Lately the app has been useless. The app does not load. This began after receiving and update. Not sure what ya'll did to ruin the perfectly functioning app. Received an email to clear cache, but to no avail. The problem persists, Please do something.
Apparently, the buggy, hard to load app wasn't enough. Now they made new update to force you transaction by installing this app, supposedly to "make it more secure" yet doesn't even show the display number, making the progress even slower. I'm beyond annoyed. This will be especially an unnecessary burden for those whose in rush to pay things or in urgent
Server lambat gila tak habis2 nak login and loading page tu pun lama, its better if online banking xyah connect to this app, it only hinder the process if this keeps up
It keeps on crashing. Difficult to switch it on when i am in the needs to use it. But its ok since i can do the transcation by web. However, worse come to worse when we need to approve everything via the same apps that always hang. It takes forever for me to transcact a money. Please do something.
Everytime update, become much slower. Did u guys make improvement or decommissioning the apps? Every urgent thing make it slower demnn so hard.
I'm using this app okay so far, but I just want the developers to fix or improve one thing, which is the length of words can be written on "Recipient Reference" and "Other Payment Details" when transferring money. This problem is really putting me at disadvantages as I can only write a few words. I cannot detail any reason or statement to my payees. So, please fix this problem as soon as possible. Yes, I'm running on above Android 7.0, I'm on Android 11. I shouldn't be facing this problem.
This app is really useless. After key in all the id, password, ic & 6 digit tac number, it says "unable to process, please contact the bank. Not user friendly at all. Please don't waste your time to download it. Really useless and waste of time. Call the bank and they also have not resolved the issue instead ask me to use the normal website to login.
This bank app by far is the worst. PLEASE FIX YOUR APP !!! It is so inconvenient. Crashes all the time. And the interface is so not user friendly. Another thing, was asked to update the app then when i did it totally cannot worked stated that the server error.
Very slow and bad service make my payment time so long and loading so long long times. Better than uninstall this app
I dont usually complaint but this time, Im getting fed up with this app!!!!!!!! I can't even log in. I use Samsung S23U, so i dont think there is a problem with my phone nor my connection. I CAN NOT EVEN OPEN THE APPS. There are a series of events that people have to wait for me to figure out my banking apps coz i can not open it so I can not pay. Please fix it as it's getting worse!!!!!!! If there is 0 star, i would give 0
Hi, it's still happening. Since past few months, this buggy app still cannot open or login. Not only app, on website too. I had to use other bank account because of this. Note that: this is not due to poor internet connection. Other mobile banking apps works perfectly, only bank islam face problems. I already clear cache and still the same is happening. Not only me, other users i know are facing the same thing. 😌
To be honest, this new update on november is so disappointed. Can't even get into the app because of the stupid *server error* notification keep appearing. Its so annoying. Now, if I want to get access to online banking I need to go to the website. That's alot of step to go through. Also all verification that need the user approval through the go app seems impossible right now.
People should have the option to transfer money using the web interface and not be forced to download an app just to complete a transaction. It's stupid and tedious. Edit: Just realise I cannot check transaction history. Nothing comes up. Only details of money going out can be seen. No details on money coming in. Shortsighted design. Very idiotic.
Worse banking app ever. Not functioning at all. Can't even appear login page !! (Error 500)
Honestly, i would say this does not deserve a star. Why ? Because how could i rate it when it could not be used at all ? Just like the others, I faced the same issue. " Unable to Connect to Server" right after I installed the new version. The website ? Oh cmmon.. the system always down and it's very inconvenient. Please do something about it.
Bila update app latest, terus tak boleh buka,, loading je mmnjang..
I wanna say that please fix the bug and loading issues, whoever is incharge with this need to update their systems and always heavy on traffic. Took lots of time to just load a single screen, and it's a waste of time.
After installing the new app, it has been so hard to open in because it kept on stuck at the starting. Most of the time shows connection failure, server failed et cetera. So far this is the worst bank app I had ever installed or use.
I cant open after updating the apps..
This app always cannot open, stuck, slow , cannot connect to server. It's so terrible and sucks. Whoever is the developer of this app, please fix it ASAP! I only use this bank because I'm still a student. I will not recommended this app or bank islam to anyone. Their service was so bad. What's the point to update it just for it to turn into slower and worse so ever!
Please la Bank Islam..do something about your GO apps..you want to force people using it, so please make it better!!!!!! If people want to use it but it keeps loading FOREVER!!! And often cant be use becouse YOU EXPERIENCE HIGH AMOUNT OF USER?? JUST SHUT DOWN THE APPS IF YOU DONT HAVE MONEY TO INVEST FOR IT AND MAKE IT BETTER. JUST STICK TO THE WEBSITE. NOW YOU MAKE IT HARD FOR YOUR CUSTOMER TO DO ANY TRANSACTION!! THAT JUST SO STUPID. PLEASE DO SOME CHANGE!!
it was smooth before. however, since Nov 22, it gets into problem. most of the time cannot acess, stuck with the loading logo endlessly. i have emailed the Bank Islam contact center and replied that newer version is available. However, uninstalled and installed the new version, problem still persistent.
Annoying. Request authorize thru apps tapi apps asik problem je -_-
I've been waiting for a day to use the app and it's not working at all STUPIDDDD Can you guys make it better faster!
I have been with bank islam for close to 20 year and always had a pleasant experience. I never had issues with the app before but of late, with your new updates, the app is not opening, lagging at start up and it is irritating when i cannot perform online banking. I have to uninstall, install many times and yet still the same. Please do the needful and ensure your customer satisfaction is not compromised!
I can't login and then when I managed to login, it said system unavailable or error. The transaction takes too long and then it cancels it due to the errors or system unavailable. I tried using browser and then it asked me to confirmed in the GO app but then I CAN'T OPEN THE APP, EVEN WHEN I CAN OPEN IT, THE CONFIRMATION TOOK TOO LONG THAT THE TRANSACTION TIMED OUT. PLEASE IMPROVE OR YOU COULD JUST LET THE CUSTOMERS USE TAC NUMBER INSTEAD OF SECURE VERIFICATION. THANK YOU.
I'm gonna rate 1 star for now. I've been using this apps for years now and I've always loved it. But now i couldn't open the apps as it kept on saying "unable to connect to server". I've tried to reinstall again yet I still faced the same problem. Pls fix this asap!
Everything is actually great until a few weeks ago when i can't open the apps. No response at all. I tried refreshed my phone, closed all other apps I'm using buy nothing. I thought that i need to update the apps but checking the apps at google store, there's no new update. So I don't know what to do. I need to open browser to check my account. Now I need to update the apps. Let's see if I can open or not, the apps after updating it.
Last month I tried opening the app but it just wont open. Today, I tried again and am shocked to see that the app still wont launch. I'm not able to authorize any transaction and has to go to the bank. It's very frustrating and inconvenient.
Unable to conect to server issue. Tried clearing cache. Issue persist. Cleared apps data (without uninstalling) and login again. Issue solved. Although was prompted with 'invalid id' at first. Have a try. Not sure if the issue will come back. Developer pls fix this bug.
I think it's okay... but i really don't like it when they ask you to update & i've updated the app, i couldn't access the app later. Can really make ppl panic since everytime i tried to access the app, app couldn't get through the server. I had to uninstall the app & install it again. I really don't want to re-do it again everytime the app need to be updated. This need to be fix.
The apps is not functioning at all, there's nothing going on if I open the apps, just the pink cakground and that's it. Not even log in, the button for that is nowhere to be seen. Its been like that for weeks, but I still try to uninstall than install it back, still the same. Hope you cam improve the system.
Difficult to access. Loading for long time. Very irritating. If i could rate ZERO STAR, i would
Please improve the app. It takes a long time to open the app, and it takes even longer to make a simple transaction.
Bad. I want to transfer using online banking, has to download n login to apps to approve. When login to apps, its automatically logoff the online banking. And it's goes on an on. Want to transfer by apps, cannot. No account registered. Favourite account already exists in online, but not exists in apps and asked me to add in online. Why la? When tye loops going to end, i don't know and i don't care. Don't wanna use both anymore
Loading until time out. Other bank apps work well and fast, but GO BI apps, very disappointing.
This app does not entitled any star. Worst experienced ever. The website is much better than apps. Problems with go secure is that after you key in digits given, the transaction will not proceed. The app will log out and i had to log in again. So irritating.
Always does not work!. Sometimes it was like forever to wait this app from buffering.
Force us to use this broken app for duit now, never gonna fix anything broken on this app... the rating also so low and did not improve anything... What ur guys problem... Stuck on stone age, never gonna improve anything... Turning blind eye event many comments on this app are negative....
Your GO app is really unreliable. GoSecure frequently hangs, causing me to be unable to complete transactions. Frustrating! The app also takes a really long time to load (5 minutes wait and it is still loading!) Henceforth when I tried logging on on a desktop, the page declined saying I was logged on somewhere else! Bank Islam, your app developer really slacks. For a bank app to be this untrustworthy speaks volume about your institution. Do something right now before you lose more customers!
I cannot login no matter how many times I reinstall the app. It keeps on showing "Unable to process your request. Please try again." over and over. Update: Now on 7 January 2023. The problem still persists despite following the advice. Cleared the cache, uninstall and install the latest version, the same problem "Unable to process your request. Please try again." over and over.
Very frustrated with this app. Already installed and reinstalled many times over but to no avail. Stucked at good morning page. What irritates me more is the way the developer addressed this VERY IMPORTANT issue by just cutting & pasting the same answer all over again. Complainers have done the install/reinstall processes, gave access to location and even called the said support number but problem still persists.....PLEASE FIX THE PROBLEM ASAP and STOP replying nonsense!!!
very bad app. bank islam needs to do something with this problem. can't even load!! internet banking's suppose to make things easier for user, not harder.
Terrible apps. Cant login after many attempts. The message said done registering but the app keep loading. Clear all cache, restarting phone. But nothing work. Very annoying since online transaction through website also need this app to approve. Please ensure the apps would be better than previous version before launch new update. If cannot be better than previous, just stick at old version or using TAC number. Please do solve this problem as fast as possible!
The worsting apps I been used, the system soooo lag and for the first register I been sign up for half hour just bcz ur system is super lag n cannot recognizer user! Hence, when I use for transfer, the authorisation also lag. Very bad experience! If your apps n system is not mature pls don't launched the apps, just keep for using the website n IT department pls focus on how to gain website security! I even don't want to give a star.
Too long to enter. Too long to load. Cant do transaction. Worthless update.
The load takes forever... Is there anyone can fix this matter? Or would it stay like this forever?
Bad experienced and never try to fix their issue. Too slow to open it.
Worst app ever. The previous still can consider enven there is up and down. I have to instal & uninstall more than 10 times but still unable to open the app. Not sure if the app was created by whom. Might be primary school student I guess
Very bad experience since the last update. I can't open the app since a month though. I thought the developer will handle this professionally and efficiently, but it's just a dream I guess... They don't even bother the 1 star rate😌.. VERY BAD APPLICATION
Apps yg paling banyak masaalah. Tak pernah nak improve comment user. Shame to islamic bank app. Masaalah server lah aper bagai. Menyusahkan user. Lebih baik tukar islamic bank yg lain. Ayat 'WE ARE CONSTANTLY WORKING TO IMPROVE OUR SERVICE .....' give the big hope but the actual 'KELAUT' until now still got problem and nothing improvement done by service provider..... don't know when the problem can be resolved.
I'm always stuck at the loading screen, and it appears a few times when going back and forth throughout the apps, not when just starting it up. I can't do business when everything is slow and stuck.
You can enter the apps, everytime open it always shown problem with server. Then I open internet banking from website at laptop. Become worst, the transaction require approval from the Apps in the phone. What the hell??? How i want to transfer money, pay bills and so ever. Useless apps.
This system need to be improved. I think about change other bank because of this. A simple transaction become complicated. When need to pay or transfer to other account but need approved through app GO bank islam.. but it was lag too long.. This system should be friendly user like other banking app such as m2u and CIMB click. This system really bother when need urgent transaction.. Bank Islam need to learn from other banking like Maybank and CIMB how to improve your system.
Worst bank app. Can't even be open. The more it update the more I kept on getting server error message. You need to have NASA level computer in order to use this stupid app. And even then I can't guarantee you can actually open it. In fact, I don't even know if they even know what NASA computer is since how so dated and backward Bank lslam is. I haven't even started about their poor services and bad UI design. Can't even view my own card transaction histories.
Always keep loading, wasting a lot of time. Kindly improve on it.
Trash apps. Trash bank. Even online transaction need to verify trough apps very inconvenient and troublesome to use. I don't even want to say what's wrong with this apps. The developers doesn't event try to improve. Worse experience ever!!
After I update the app a week ago, this app has become useless. I even unistalled and installed it back. The problem still persist though. Cannot use it at all and everytime I tried to login there is always error message appeared saying " the app is currently experiencing a high volume of traffic ".. Really?
Always will have issue with it. And I can't see my balance. It will show unable to connect to server. Like everytime you wanna use the app it will have its issues which is so ridiculous. What is the developers doing with this amount of feedback aren't they supposed to come with and update???. So frustrating to use this app which is so useless.
Its worse apps. Always loading at the end cannot enter cause of error. Please upgrade apps.
It's very slow and shows a lot of error. I was trying to transfer money to my friend and the app logged out by itself. It's hard to pay with QR scan because I have to wait more than 5 minutes
Before the update last year, this apps was great... Then after the end of october 2022, i can't use it anymore after it updated into the new version... Everytime i try to key in my data, it shows up #400 Bad Request... I had call the customer service to fix it up but it remain same
Worst Bank-Apps ever. Took 2-3 days to log-in. Sometimes longer than that. Worst on payday. Have to uninstall, and then reinstall, so that can log-in. But the problem will repeat itself again and again. The bank never upgraded this app. Makes millions of profit, but apps macam sampah. Other banks never had this kind of problems.
Assalamualaikum, the app always crash whenever I open it. But after I update my phone operating system "Android OS", I finally get to use it properly, so far no problem for me. I finally can pay my flight tickets. Anyone reading this, I hope this is useful for you too. You should update your phone's OS before using this app. Or maybe update every single system app in your phone.
Getting worse now since the app updated few months ago. Keep getting stuck at starting page and ended with unable to connect to the server. Have been uninstalled and reinstalled hoping to be better but nothing improved. It is UNUSABLE and waste of time.
I love the apps. It's so convenient. The updates get better and better everytime. The best part is they provide you transaction receipt where in the website we need to screenshot. I hope you can add 'email' for refference too. Because normally online seller asked to put their email. Thank you and good work!
Too terrible experience, I want to make transaction and need GO apps to approve it. But, the apps mentioned "unable to process your request" and keep loading this statement. After re-install it, problem still can't solve. Now, I have to use another bank account. The apps is totally worse, why the technical team didn't settle the problem since it check the review here, already found many user have the same issues.
I'm having the same problem too. Fortunately after calling the Customer Service team, they advised me to uninstall the App and redownload again. It's work! Prior to that, need to make sure your Android version must be at least 9. Hope this helps for other users who facing the same prob.
I feel like i was forced to download this app when i want to make a transaction through website. And it's not so user friendly anyway. Lagi terkejut when i had to go website just to favorite an account baru boleh transfer thru the app. and i can't top up my phone bcs the button doesnt pop up after i've completed fill in everything! disappointed tapi terpaksa jugak guna.
always have issue while opening the app, please fix as soon as posible cause its the bank that i use to withdraw my money.
Lousiest Apps! Sorry to say this.! It's not the first but for so many times! Pls upgrade your system or else don't develop any apps, better!
Very baddd app so slow and keep loading , sometimes have an issue to login & makes me need to reinstall for so many timessss 😤 please improve this app ASAP
The app is the worst of its kind in the world. Under performing and keep on crashing. When I uninstalled it and installed it back, I couldn't log in and it deregister my device, meaning I'd not be able to receive any notification.
Always looping, never launching. Had to use browser to access my accounts. worse update ever.
Please fix the app. The apps always have problem. Cannot open the apps due to heavy traffic, cannot open qr at all. Please fix this, it's almost 5 months. I've been deleting and reinstalling this apps just to make sure the apps run smoothly. Please fix this
The fingerprint access is too slow, waited for the whole 2 minutes just to access my account, and it appears to be going on forever so I close the app. You might want to check your fingerprint access system.
Really disappointed with the overall performance by the apps or website. Super slow. I'm not sure whether it is worth it to give a star. ............ No improvement at all since my last comment on July this year. Still takes time to load before may enter the main page. Really spoil the "Islam" name.
I shouldn't gave any single star instead.Apps is keep on and on updating but seem like become more worse. Did cleared cache several times but it doesn't work. Really disappointed, BI Should alert and fix asap. Again I uninstalled and reinstalled.. Totally unable to open. What is happening...???😡😡😡 BETTER SHUT DOWN THIS BLOODY APP..👹👹👹
This system is so bad.. very2 lag and slow.. why there is no action from BIMB eventhough get bad rating?? NO IMPROVEMENT!
Before this using website very easy. Until using this app, my withdraw rejected multiple times. Wasting time. I hope bank Islam fix this issues.
The web is wayyyyy more better. Maybe should hire the right talent rather than recommendations to fix stuffs....pssstttt
THE APPS NOT ABLE TO CONNECT. SAME GOES TO ONLINE BANKING. ERROR --> YOUR ACCOUNT NUMBER NOT CORRECT (EVENTHOUGH THE NUMBER WAS CORRECT). TRANSACTION UNSUCCESSFUL.
Worst experience. Do something please, can't even open it properly. "Unable to connect to server" I tried every WiFi possible but still can't. Even though I rarely used Internet banking the app still not fixed from I don't know 6 month ago??? Imma need to change bank if this continues
Always server error eventhough i have update this app😩😩 what need i do ?!
Server error. I'm trying to change the limit that requires authentication from this app but the server error. I have updated & restarted my phone but still having the same issue. But after receiving replied from the developer on how to overcome the issue, the problem has been solved. Thank you.
Month before the app runs smoothly & superb,but all went downhill. Apps runs slow,needed few tries to get the App open,even restarting the phone,apps & clearing cache wont solve the problem! im currently using the latest update there was,no change at apps behavior.its unacceptable for good bank as yours.
Apps load too slow, last time when i was about to pay using qrcode at the cashier, i can order 1 more meal and eat and this apps still havent load.
After go through the register process, still cant open the apps although i received the message that told me the app have been successfully register.
The app was super slow. It's so inconvenience when we need to make payment as the app is super duper slow. Even if you get to login, the payment process was also slow. Please la do something. It's been months! Jangan sampai users tukar to bank lain sampai u guys have no money to roll for other purposes.
The app keep on saying "Bank Islam has stopped" when I try to open it. My phone still okay and got no problem with the other apps. I tried the clear cache method and it's still the same even reinstall it too. Either you're gonna fix it or use the old method by using OTP instead of telling us to use this app to complete the transfer for higher payment.
Too bad experience that i uad with this apps. Can't complete my online transaction because need to approve on app but your app not function well.
the apps is getting worse day by day. cant even log in because the server error. when will you guys fix your servers so that more users can use it at the same time????
Always the same problem, can't open the app
The worse app. Never work when I need to use it. I still need to log in to the website to do any transaction
I don't even know what the hell is going on with this app. It USED to work, now it takes ages to load to the login screen (and I have good data and home Internet speed). If you get pass login, going into other menus takes forever to load. I'd prefer to just TnG for cashless payment than DuitNOW because of how SLOW this app runs now.
Just wanted to let the devs know that the app was not able to connect to the BIMB server after the latest update. I tried updating, clearing cache, clearing storage and nothing works. It only worked again after reinstalling the app. I loved the app but it will be even more amazing if the GUI is more fluid, though that's just me being picky. Hopefully the next update is smooth as it's been a recurring issue. Kudos to the devs.
Please fix the app. Sometimes it takes time to load, unable to connect to server but when accessing internet banking through the browser works just fine. A few times I had to reinstall the app just to fix the server error. It annoys me because clearing cache doesn't help at all to reset the connection to server. Why is that a problem? Basically the app becomes completely useless when the error starts popping up, reinstalling is the only option. We use this almost daily now.
Previous version apps are more batter than current apps. After I updated to a new apps the apps seems having a bad issues. 1. It is hard to open, and it takes more time to open. Loading too long. 2. Even though1 managed to log in, when I choose, as an example, to transfer a money, the apps will be loaded again, and it takes a long time to load. 3. Not so friendly like before, because when I would like to check other things inside the apps, the same issue happens. Please make changes

I cannot even pay using online banking due to problem service.
NOT USER FRIENDLY AT ALL!!! Last review, 1 star on December 2022, until today Nov 2024, this apps does not improve much. They include fingerprint to make the access easier, but not easy at all. I can easily access to see ny account with 1 time using fingerprint eith other banking apps, but not with this app. To open each section, it loading for so long. To get approval for transaction also take some time. What's the point moving to 5G era, but your app still slow.
for the past week I couldn't get pass the starting screen of the app and thus i can never access the app anymore. i have checked if there's any update but there were none and my phone meets the app requirement system. the web browser works fine but it is frustrating bc i can't use the app anymore to do instant transfers. fix this issue please this is too absurd
Cannot launch the app. Tried everything and yet the login page never appear, stucked at the front page forever. Read the latest reviews, and the developer keep on telling to update to latest version (3.2.09), which is what everyone already have update to, or use phone with android 9 and above. No solution or whatsover. Very disappointed with how little they care about clients' experience.
The app is so slow, and it will not open at all. I have to uninstall the app and reinstall it every time i want to use the app. After reinstalling, I can only use it once. The second time I try to use it, the same thing happens, and I will have to uninstall again. After reinstalling the app, I can't make any transfers to other banks for the next 12 hours. I feel like closing my account just because of this. This app is not convenient at all. In fact, it is troublesome to the users.
Too many errors occuring from time to time Either not being able to log in, not able to use the QR, and even worse, not even able to open the apps even after waiting for quite some time. Had to uninstall then reinstall the app. It is annoying as you need to enter your data all over again
PLEASE DO SOMETHING TO THE APPS!! after installed the updated version, it is always loading and stuck at the start up n i cant open the apps. Update on 28 oct 2023, i believe there is no improvement that bank islam done to their apps, which is super non friendly user, lagging, need to open and log in several times, i almost forget my password because rarely use it due to the issues.

Useless app !  Most of the time take time to load unable to connect to server. It's really frustrating. I had to reinstall the app when I need to do the transaction. Annoying !!!
i will close my account because if this incompetent app. now that you force to use app to validate any transfer but it does not even connect. i have clear cache, update, uninstall and reinstall before you even try to ask for me to update this app. even tried with wifi and my mobile 5G speed. this is just pure garbage of an app.
25/8/23: Guess I'm not changing my opinion anytime soon. Very, very rarely it was fast. Rest of the time? So slow that I forgot I have to pay for something. Now? I can't even go to the main page, keeps telling me to reinitiate transaction. WT--?? Like I have no life to live, is it, to wait for the app to actually work?
the most stupidest banking app.. it will take forever to load. on top of that if you want to perform duitnow transfer through the browser, you still need to open your go app. it's so annoying and it really makes me angry. i have very stable internet connection. Hey bimb please learn from cimb how to operate an app.
Unable to connect the server? Already update the latest version (as of 7 October 2023). Already uninstall and install again to see if it's working, but still doesn't working. If we need to call the center, every user of this app will end up calling Bank Islam. The problem is this app itself.
Very disappointing experience using bank islam go, it takes forever just to get to the log in screen, not to mention the problem while scanning qr codes and many more.. what's the point of yall taking RM 13 from our bank accounts if you didn't do anything to fix the goddamn app..no one will be furious if there is a slight inconvenience for a short period of time, but this app has been giving people nothing but trouble for quite some time..please step up your IT teams
Why i kept getting error "400 bad request", although i already key in my correct password and id also the tac number. After that error, the app send me msg that i already registered yet unable to to log in. Please resolve this, i already uninstall and reinstall for several time.. Dear BIMB, Again this app really needs improvement. As from all customers that seems to have the same issues, we really need you to solves it fast for us to used it again.
Please please please do stg about the app start up, I can't open the app no matter how many times I tried, and since some transcation require verification from this app it's really frustrating! Why in the world does everything need verification from the app anyway, the duitnow I get, the jompay I get, but why funds transfer too????
Sometimes it's working.... sometimes NOT. It continues to buffer. So unfriendly users. In fact my phone is new, install & uninstall 3 times by now & updated the apps to the latest version. But still the SAME prob reoccurring. Fix you apps pls!
Too slow, the app keep loading and in the end, the session expired just like that. One more thing... it keeps telling us to UPDATE BUT NOTHING'S CHANGED!! STILL THE SAME PROBLEMS OCCUR WHILE USING THE APP!! Please make improvement on the app so that IT WILL BE EASIER FOR US, THE USER OF THE APP!!
Often to unistall and install. Also been waiting for the IAC to be send to my number take years. Requested for so many times still did not received any In case of emergency to do any transaction, this is very much troublesome. Transaction via website also need approval from GO Bimb. How to if I can't even open the apps ?
I will be honest. This app is the worst. The loading takes too long for me to open the app. If its only a minute or two is okay but it takes 5 mintues or even more just to load? I've heard the issue is not new which proves this app is just that bad.
I've already updated to the new version but still couldn't open the app.. I don't know why it cannot connect to the server. I've tried using both wifi and data but still can't open.
Very bad apps.. Always stuck and nothing happened after wait 10 minutes. Causing me very bad experience to transfer money using western Union and PFX with your apps. Very very very bad!!!!
the apps are so bad, clear cache, etc, still unable to open the apps. Online transactions through the website need approval through GO secure, but nothing can be approved since the apps only trying to load the entire time
Took super long to open the apps. Most of the time i gave up. Would rather transfer all my money to other banks, easier when i need to do duitnow payment at the store. Im super close to stop using this app.
I mean i understand that many people are using this app, but you have to accommodate good service to them. Make frequent maintenance, if u already did u have to make it even more frequent. Please people are just trying to get their transactions through and if u are wishing to keep them as customers, please improve.
Frequently got problem to share the transaction receipt. There are 2 ways to share receipt in GO apps .... thru (menu) history mobile transaction or thru individual account transaction history. Both got blank receipt. My phone OS is Android version 13. GO apps version 3.2.09.
The app was very very veryyyyyy slowwwwww!!!!!! Couldn't make any transactions with this app. I am beyond disappointed. Edit: after the recent update, there's no more slow loading so i think they deseve more star
i want to carry out fpx transaction. so i need to use go app to approve the transaction. and goes on loading till the last 120s of the transaction. and when i got at the login page press go secure to approve the transaction. it repeatly tell me the transaction has expired, when i still have 120s. i did a few more time with the same result till transaction have really expired. ok i give another go, i reinstall the app, reregistered it for 3 more time to do the fpx and it still waste my time
From bad to worse. It was already laggy and slow before. Since the update, takes close to forever to load(my internet is running at 500mbps) . And the interface is very buggy. I can't do any transactions just an endless loop of returning to the home screen. I end up using chrome or my PC for any online transactions. Please this app really needs a major update & revamp. At a time when most things are online you might loose more customers bcoz other app(bank) are better
If there is an option to give 0 star, damn sure I'd give it without hesitation. Every time updates coming this app has become much much worse than before. Please fix your app and your server so we can log in without issue. Fix the damn issue asap or else we will port to another bank.
Half an hour loading to open the apps. Very very very bad apps for such a big finance company. Please let us used the browser instead of this app.. I repeat.. Very.. Very....very very.. Bad and junk apps.
I hate this app ever.... From September until the end of October, this app can't perform well even i have updated it... I can't do anything to my money in the bank. Already made some reports via email and call centre for this issue. Seem like no action from them.
Not intuitive to use. I cancelled my transfer settings and press OK on the dialog option, nothing happened, not even to the homepage. I tap on back button and the app not responding at all. Can't even find ASNB account summary or related (not transaction) but the bank have that service, really not good. Edit: No error, I wrote "Nothing happened" means I got any feedback from that? No, you didn't code any error message. That's even worst.
Unable to login,Already clear and uninstall the app.Still get the same error. There is no more,Go secure for approve transaction purpose.It is very dangerous since no safety in online transaction. YES,this is the latest version of app.
Worst app ever exist! Very slow and u need to activate go secure even for small amount transfer. Waste of time!! Once lag, it's going to lag forever.. in the end, need to uninstall and install it again. No improvement despite people giving reviews. Don't bother to create an app if it's only cause trouble every time u need to use it!!
My rating for this app has plummeted significantly lately among financial apps that I've used. Worst experience and seems buggy, it hangs frequently and randomly unresponsive, not able to connect, etc. Not easy for online payment. Getting tired of all sorts of issue for a financial apps from a Bank. Really needs to buck up and hope security is no compromised though!
Greetings to whom it might concern. You are a bank institution. There supposedly should not be any crashes, trouble opening, and unable to connect to the server every time. Please do something about this. I am so tired of having to close and open the app every time I wanted to do transactions and approvals. Worst, re-installing for dozens of times. Thus, I had trouble making simple payments. I hope to actually use your banking app smoothly. I look foward to see some improvements.
I have no words for how much I hate this app. Recently updated, now my transfer limit can't be changed on the app. It's a different limit from the mobile site, and it's a ridiculously low limit that I can't do anything with. Uninstalling and reinstalling for the umpteenth time and hope (yet again) that this will fix the problem.
Im so proud of bank islam. Most of the time this app cannot work, always loading screen and server error. However, rather than solving this issue you guys have a great idea by making transactions approval using the go app. So if we successfully log into the portal using web browser, we still need to open the app which is 99% does not work. What a fantastic idea! Btw, stop using AI to reply all reviews. Clearing cache wil not solve anything for this garbage system
Please upgrade your apps. Tells me to update, after updating the app, it says cannot connect to the server. Need to uninstall and re-install. Tired of doing the same thing all over again...if i can give u zero star, i would. Worst banking app ever. I don't know how many times already i uninstall and reinstall your app. Don't tell me about phone spec, never encountered this problem on any other banking app. 😤
Worst ever online banking app I've ever experienced. After having to install, uninstall and reinstall, it still failed to function. Doesn't even deserve 1-star. Please buck up!! and emulate other banks' secure app that have been proven to perform, no need to reinvent the wheel, just get it sorted out before imposing on customers to use such app for our online banking transactions.
App not responsive to touch input on landing/login page. Uninstalled and reinstalled still unresponsive, cannot tap 'get started'. Hope can fix soon.
Actually not bad if you compare with other bank software. User friendly UI, Easy to use, just abit slow sometimes. Other all good for me.
After update, cannot connect to the server. Need to uninstall and install it again. Loading time too long when need to do secure pay, untill timeout. Not much improvement compare to other internet banking apps after a year from my last reviewed.
I can see this app is improving. My only complaint is that it would be nice if this app would let guest user login using the app that already has a registered user ID. Sometimes, I'm helping my mom doing online transactions when I was at hostel, so it was troublesome to deregistered my Go bank account just to use Go secure using my mom Go bank account.
the app just updated and now i can't even make it to the login screen because of "server error". it's a pain and i need to use the app for online and cashless transactions, do fix this problem ASAP
too many bugs,slow apps eventhough signal at the area in good condition, need to improve on the apps efficiency,unable to screenshot as a evidence while performing any transaction.
Slow loading apps. Very, very, very, slow loading apps. Not that user friendly. Always had trouble using this apps.
Asked me to update employment status when I tried to login through web browser but need to approve via app. Downloaded the app, but need to enable unnecessary permissions. When enabled, server connection error. Head father you, your mother green.
Loading too long. Sometimes not working. Been using for so long but the problem still the same. Never improve. Difficult when trying to pay with qr code cause need to wait for too long.
I tried to transfer money from using website, it refuses and ask me to use this app. But when I install the app and try to transfer, I keep getting error "You are not allowed to perform this monetary transaction for 12 hours".
At account details page, my money are still there but it keep decreasing at home pages. It's frustrating. I can't make transaction. It keeps saying i don't have balance left
Pure connection. Already update handphone to android 10, but still fail to connect, although after using variety of internet line.
Notice that there is improvement on the application, especially it is much faster than before, which makes QR payment is possible. Keep up the good work.
The newer version app has improved a lot. No more lagging. Easy to log in. Online transfer has been easy. A+ for team effort
Unable to login after newly installed in new phone. Keeps saying connection to server is lost. Please fix. Thank you.
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE fix your app sometimes it will suddenly became error and i need to reinstall it REINSTALL ITT !!! IT'S SO FRUSTRATING !!! BECAUSE I USED THIS APP FOR MY DAILY WHEN I REINSTALL IT AGAIN I NEED TO WAIT 24 HOURS TO DO THE TRANSACTION (24 HOURS 24 HOURS) YOU THINK I HAVE TIME TO WAITTTT. I already read someone chat and i read your reply . You said you already fixed it. But you lying the problem are still not fixed .
Edit Again: Alhamdulillah the app nowadays is usable enough. They get rid of the useless feature that caused the app unusable in the previous version
Now it's unusable. Keep giving me error code 500 (APZ_TSN_500). I did everything I could, reinstall, clear cache and data. Only work for a brief moment after I reinstall / clear data and it doesn't work after I close and try to open the app. For some reason, it works perfectly on my friends phone.
Every single time when I want to use go app , it crashed . Why can't you just like before ? Sending TAC through SMS , it's a lot more easier and after using GO app everything when really bad .
Hi again its me your customer. Recently I try to make a few purchases from tiktok shop but after the first purchase, the system started to go crazy and it can't even able to process my purchase anymore. It unfortunately cancelled out my promo payment hence why I'm rating it 1 star. Please kindly fix this issue.
lousy lousy lousy still..updated oct 2023 . Frustrating lately since up-dating this app recently, always unable to connect. Why give us this trouble now? after many years hassle free without un-install and install. Fix this!!! Nothing being done. Stop replying me the same stupid answer like the others.
I want to pay my uni fee, but I can't pay it through online because it's keep loading. I prefer, the old version where we just need to put code from SMS from need permission from aps. Because this app will stuck. I want to pay my uni fee!!!!
Sorry to say. Very bad and bad system ever. After update the latest one I cannot access my online banking. Always lagging all the time even though using wifi. Waste time waiting & drag my time also.
The apps took tooooo long to open since the update. It hinder all my transfer since it need go secure and the page won't open even the homepage. Please fix it asap
Worst bank app service ever. Low maintenance and really annoying to handle such simple tasks. Buffer all the time and not even a message to inform in the app have problems to be fixed.
Apps Loading time during peak and non peak hours are terrible. If other banks's apps can be efficient in terms of loading time and etc, bank islam should make initiatives to develop an app that is on par with other apps. Show some class 😮‍💨
Your notification was so bad. No information regarding the need to upgrade, uninstall and reinstall. Your sense of urgency is so bad that you not allow customer to perform transaction right after installing the app. Instead, you asked for a cooling off 12 hours? Are you running a beta version on BIMB customer? You made 12 hours of misery.
I cleared app cache and data. Tried again. Its working. Thank you. Just that the tag that comes in into the phone only works at the second attempt.. not the first.
Bad experience, and looks like no improvement even though customers rate low. I think you should test your apps thoroughly. It is still the same even you have upgraded the version. Please be serious on improving your customer experience.
I am using this app since last 3 years. This is so frustrating. The App doesn’t work when you need it the most. I think the developers of this App are too lazy to fix the issues. Going to switch to another bank this week. Bye bye Bank Islam.
cannot use during payday week, most of the time hang during transaction,go apps becomes not go apps..the 1st version way much better than current. What a dissapointed experienced!
Its getting worse..i hope you guys can fix this problem..its already a couple of days but i still can't login to the apps..i always update the apps..but it's doesn't seem to be a changes at all..
Truly disappointed! After so many attempt trying to login with password still invalid! We only able to login with same password and username thru website using chrome browser. Please do something with your crash app!
Very slow. Every day I will uninstall and reinstall back. Than need to wait another 12hrs for transfer. Poor app. Why keep continue such services. Very sorry. Very frustrating.
The worst experience ever in all history of Online Banking app. This app is super slow considering how every user's bank account need verification from this app and yet it took forever to load. Such disappointment
The previous version is much better than now. I can't even log in to do my transaction and there's always error that I getting annoyed now 😑. Please fix it quickly
The latest mandatory update is full of bugs. I can't open it well especially when I need to transfer my money. The previous version is way better.
Please make an improvement to your apps, I'm very frustrated and annoyed each time to make any payments because this apps keep take a long time on loading page before going to login page. Please Bank Islam, do better.
The apps is not workable, lagging and not able to log in all the times, resulting in broken dateline and promises( so not islamic at all). Pls pls do something or do we need to report to PMX as well. It has improved and i m satisfied now
After updating still no improvement. After one transaction succsess, next transaction always failed. Always need to log out and delete cache, then can do the transaction. Becoming worst every year.
Can't login, at first didn't approved access, then as it is compulsory, allowed the access, but get error "Unable to connect to the server" Off, clear cached, still can't get through
i can't log in Go By Bank Islam (it said Invalid Credential) eventhough i updated to the latest version and my device is not old version, i told to the email (contact centre) and no response at all, please fix it ASAP, i need to use the app
Just recently update the app, and now i can't even open it😑 it says can't connect to server. Edited: thank you Bank Islam. I follow ur instruction. I delete my app and install it again. It worked
One of the worst app that I ever downloaded. I used to pay via fpx online but after the new update, I need to get permission from this Go app and sometimes it doesn't even work and after the latest update I can't pay to purchase something online💆‍♂️
Very inconvenient. Unstable and non worked app. Cant even open the app and just keep loading. I want to give negative star for this useless thing. Rework this disappointing thing.
Cannot access Tabung Haji even with latest update. App condition somehow as if it's an app made by a guy who just build their first app. It's bank app so with current performance, it's a disappointment.
Told me to use the app instead of website. But the app cannot even open. So how can I transfer and stuff. So disappointed especially during emergency...
Why does it keep buffering? I'm unable to make any purchases. Help please Latest: I've already updated it. Still the same, is it need a very good internet connection?
Please I'm begging you please update and fix the system..its been down with server error for weeks and this is not the 1st time. Sometimes it takes hours just to load -whattt??
Hi there, what has happened to this app, I can't log in even i tried many time. Previous version has better version than this new version. Please improve this kind of problem.
Unusable. App will stay on the loading page endlessly. Its been going on for months! Update 02/10/2023: Latest updates makes it even worse. Did you guys hire a bunch monkeys to manage this app? Didn't gave them enough bananas?
apsal app ni slow sgt.. Bi kena lebih improve customer service n satisfaction ni.. 4 app yg lain semua jauh lbh lancar. Once account freezed, and it keep repeating wrong password.. and u have to wait for 12 hours to make a transaction, this is nonsense service.. I'll better move to other banks..
Worst mobile apps ever. It didn't work properly and not even able to open it most of the time especially for Android user.
The app some time not available as before . The loading process take a several times. Some time i got fed up with this app. Please make it smooth like your take it money from us.
for many times, i try and try but still cannot login and of course it happens during the most urgent period. worthless apps!
Previous update was better than current. Dont know if there any maintenance, app and web both take more time loading and lag when enter it. Please make good your system
The app almost always show error, saying gobank experiencing high volume traffic. Very hard to do online transaction which will need to use go secure.
Please upgrade you apps. Very slow. Unable to do transaction especially paying bill etc.. Thinking to migrade to other bank if no action taken to solve the problem
Struggle to access. I had reinstall for 5th time a day. It's very hard to access. Just used website. Please fix the problem. It's make us not happy with this latest version. Actually, time to time, this apps could be easy and friendly to use. Hopefully, please go through for this problem first. This is the major problem from the others. Thank you.
Developer's please improve more on your apps . Always being freak all the time . Waiting too long to log in . Please la find a better or more high intelligence IT artist for your apps like the other bank . Not make user easy but burden them .
4 Oct 2023: Everything goes smoothly for now. Still can improve the UI. Thank you to everyone involved. Up to 4 ⭐
I love the app although they have problem loading quite a lot. I use it mainly because i connect it to the tabung haji. But i cant do it anymore. Why is that?
Transfer all my money to bimb because i lost my Maybank card. Now i cannot do any online transaction due to this app keep on loading till kiamat. Damn very sucks. Why need approval from this app when your system very bad. Nak beli makanan pon cannot pay using qr pay
Seriously this apps is too slow!! I can't perform a simple money transaction due to the apps just loading itself and I waited for a whole 30 minutes just for the apps to open!!! Even tho it's like that it seems like there's no improvement from the developer to upgrade their application performance... seriously a horrible experience for a cashless person like me.
Very bad application. server always down. Error communication with server. Lag too long. Application did not have user-friendly. Any update did not change anything but make it worse. For technical issue, always be late and too long for maintenance. Suggestion: please improve your server, make staff trained very well for apps, do some testing apps before release it. If apps always crash, make sure ask opinions from another.
Srsly, this system must be improved. I am thinking bout changing my service bcs of this. A simple transaction bcome complicated as h*ll. Byk sgt maintanance. Yeah, a system should be frequently maintaned but the frequency of this app being maintance is just too much and sometimes so abrupt .it bother the urgent transaction. Not only that,the application has tons of problem. Slow.
The worst online banking app. It took so long to just open the app. It will just keep on loading I need to wait for a very long time for the app to literally open for me to do my payment. I need to open the app super early if I want to use the app. There's no nice experience for me while using this app. I really hope that your technology/it team could rework or do something to make the app run smoothly. People has been talking about this problem since forever and I can't see any improvements.
If the App fails, at least makes it relinquish hold of the account. Else, one can get stuck not being able to access an account from either web client or mobile, effectively locking one out of his/her own account! Update: Reliability gets worser with every update. Daily transaction limit has mistakenly being changed from the basis of accumulated amount transferred daily to just a single transaction per-day. Might as well just close your account if you rely on mobile banking at this point.
The apps really bad. You want to make every transaction need to be verified by GO. But almost everytime I do a transaction the verification not pop up from GO apps and the GO apps always can't be open due to high volume. It's really really bad!! Please improve your system!
Please upgrade the apps. Loading time to open the apps is unstable. Sometimes it's working fine, sometime it took forever. Making it hard to perform transaction. Especially, when using Go Secure. I am able to receive notification from other apps while the apps loading for Go Secure. I believed it is not my mobile network problem. Please fix the issue. Online banking apps should be seamless as we are practicing cashless transaction for the norm.
This has to be the worst apps for a bank. You cannot even access and the page rotates like drops of blood oozing and oozing. Even using the website, as payment has to be made, when it transfers to the apps, the apps does not respond promptly until you have delayed payment in your waiting list. Unfortunately, has to be cancelled and switch to another bank service. This has to be the worst nightmare for Bank Islam customers. I would rate this apps zero star for incompetence, slow & irresponsive.
Deserves no star. Time is of the essence when it comes to financial transactions, but with this app constantly crashing, it defeats the whole purpose of having an app for financial transaction. Don't introduce an app if it cannot serve it's purpose. What is the point of me having to approve online banking transaction on the go app if the go pp constantly crashes??? No transaction can go through? Just stick to the code being sent to your phone???
Dear admin, please fix your bugs in this app ASAP. The latest update makes everything worse. I can't even open the app, and I can't even transfer online banking at all. If the app isn't gonna get fixed, it's hard for the users to proceed online transaction. I've tried uninstalled the app and reinstall it back but still the same. So pls fix the bug as soon as possible.
Very annoying. It take a longer time to open the apps. After waiting for so long, the server down and unable to access it . Unhelpful and terrible services . Looks like i may have to uninstall it and change to another bank.
This current version apps are very bad than previous. After I updated to new apps, i having a lot problem to login to do transactions. Its take more times to open because it loading too long. Not so friendly like before. Please do something about that, otherwise you will lose so many customer later. Thank you
29th Jan 2022: GO apps keep loading for quite some time. I've updated my password and even try to reinstall it. But still the issue doesn't resolved. I've been calling customer service/support to identify what's the root cause. Can anyone from IT team able to solve it? 26th June 2023: It getting worse. Seriously it getting worse. Loading time, response time after key in password, transferring money as well (during OTP seems faster), now approving via Apps took a lot of time. Really frustrating
Very frequent system hang. Then I will have to uninstall and reinstall back. Pls improve system reliability and stability. Tq 23 June 2023 Still no improvement with the apps. I still have to uninstall and re install every single time I want to access the Go apps. Worse now it says I can only do transaction 12 hours after! 3rd time already. And you can guess when I try to login after 12 hrs, the apps will just flicker forever and I have to again uninstall and reinstall back. Pls revamp the app.
Actually the app don't deserve ay star at all, I can't even log in despite connected to wifi. The system always lagging and crash, even I'm trying to transfer to my own account. The latest instructions want to encourage the user to use GO apps for any transactions but sadly, the GO apps getting worst without trying.
The app has been working fine for a few weeks but now it suddenly keeps saying to the traffic is high, all the time. And i suddenly have a limit for interbank transfers which doesn't make sense. Just please hire a good team to sort out all these issues.
Worst app ever. Does not even start. And it's supposed to be an authticator!???? Please fix this. I cannot do important transactions because of this!!
It takes yearsss to load. I need to approve a transaction and it takes forever to open the apps. Please do something about this.
Very bad apps.. always crash, hang up, missing favorite acc setting, exceed tx limit error, etc etc 😩👎👎👎...prev version much better...I am frustated during every end of the month when you need to pay a lot of thing..but hopeless... I will terminate my bank account soon (fyi, i am acc holder since 1993)...bye bye
Took forever to launch and it is not user friendly. Admin needs to respond to this matter and find better solutions to improve customers' experiences. An app is supposed to make things easy, not the other way round. Worst service ever. I can't believe that the developer doesn't even bother to address the customers' feedbacks on the app/service performance
Loading more than 1 minute!!! Latest update but nothing changed. Still take a long time to open this app. If I need to do any online transaction😌 then need to get approval from this app, its really not help. I literally spend 2 hours sometimes just to make sure I can make online transaction. High traffic and loading whatsoever are not a joke when the online transfer time only 100+ seconds. Please do improve your apps. It supposedly secure and easy to use. Not just secure and unusefull.
The worst banking app ever. Took forever to login, always buffering. Cannot detect fingerprint and keep on error when logged in by password. Things get harder whenever I want to make urgent transaction. PLEASE do something about all this problems. It is inconvenience in so many ways
worst app ever. it took more than 5 hours to get the receipt of transaction. been loggin in and out. installing and uninstalling. still no improvement. please fix. should deserve no star at all. tired of complaining. same excuses all the time. how much time do you still need to fix this app? it takes forever for you to try to fix this thing is it? and still, no changes ???🤷🏻‍♀️
This app is a mess, cant do anything smoothly. Please improve your server. I cant access it 80% of the time. Even online transfer using computer is a hassle because the final authorization is through the app which you cant access most of the time.
I cannot even log in at all. I only have this bank and turns out its the worst. Someone needs to fix this app. The app said the IAC is sending me verification code but i didnt receive anything??? Whenever i wanna do online transaction and it asked me to confirm through GO as the final step, I CANNOT GET THROUGH. ITS SO FRUSTRATING. GETTING ON MY NERVES.
So technically cannot use anymore is it? I need to pay my college fee, and it requires confirmation from this app. How do i even do that, this app hasn't worked for almost a year
Slow and annoying...try to open the apps but it keeps on loading till hours, thus delay the validation process of a payment or transaction.
I can't use it everytime I try I just server error( unable to connect to the server) But other people can I already reinstall the app update my phone it still not working
Trash apps. If you want to force people to use apps for online payment, make sure it works in the first place. Crash, cannot login, taking ages to try 1 transaction. I hasn't managed to complete a single transaction since being forced to use the apps.
Not a good option if you want to use this apps as your main account. It takes forever to load for login. I have uninstall and reinstall again. Still the same problem. Better to have another account which has more user friendly mobile apps like MAE or CIMB. Today 20/9/23 still same problem. These comments mean nothing perhaps.
I usually use mobile browser to make transfer in Bank Islam. But now you put another filter as in to approve transaction in this GO app. It's good on paper, because another security authentication is always good, BUT THIS GO APP IS ALWAYS UNRESPONSIVE. Imagine a simple transfer takes nearly an hour just to be responsive. Shame on you. It's 2023 but this app likes like it was build in 90s. And NO! I will not reach you at the email given. Step up your game or you'll lose many more users like me.
I recently used the Bank Islam Apps, and it left me thoroughly disappointed. The app's slow performance led to frustrating delays, leaving me waiting embarrassingly outside a restaurant. Adding to the frustration, I was informed that I had to wait a staggering 12 hours before I could make a much-needed money transfer. It was an emergency, and the app failed to provide a timely solution. In desperation, I resorted to using the website, which thankfully worked fine
The system experiences delays until it times out, in Islam is sinful to kill people , this app leads people die fast due to stressful using the app. Therefore, it's essential to invest more in bandwidth. Additionally, there was a security flaw in Duitnow that allowed a hacker to empty my account yesterday
Getting worst, cannot open. Please fix it asap. Cannot transfer or doing anything online. Bodoh punya apps. Still same problem after update. Stupid. Ur apps terrible
After update new version, cannot log in..loading too long..waste my time to do any transactions..so disappointed. Please fix this problems.
I've had quite a frustrating experience with this app. Picture this: you're in the process of confirming a purchase, and you're given just one minute to do so. However, the app takes an eternity to load, and when the time finally runs out, all the items in your cart disappear, forcing you to start the search all over again. It's a situation that leaves me truly disappointed, and I believe Bank Islam should take this feedback seriously. What a shame.
Very slow and unresponsive when selecting several features within the app. Looking forward for improvements in the near future. I expect it to be as good as CIMB clicks app
Mandatory but annoying whenever we need it the most. It lags during online transactions and multiple attempts at reinstalling often leads to confusion. The old ways were pretty much better.
Technology is getting more sophisticated. But this application is still outdated. Please.. Make the maybank2u example always up to date
Such a stressful life using this app. Always problem to log in, very slow server, and even I had uninstall and re-install this app almost 10 times. Sometime this app recommend to use internet banking if this app was in high traffic, but same thing happened. Is hard for me almost all the times whenever I want to pay for ptptn, bill, online payment just because of this app. Overall, this app very not helpful at all. Is makes me stress out even more.
If u want us to update for a better version, make sure that this application is not slow and always loading, I'm tired with this apps, newer but slower version, so what the point of updating if all this things the user need to exprience? Please keep maintaining your apps for better version, fix it asap!
Current version not user friendly. Always have an issue when try to log in and take time to load. The apps keep down whenever we try to open. Please help to fix this. Very difficult for a user to use the apps.
Simple, yet full of features. Unfortunately, not 5-star as it's sometimes difficult to access.
I would give 0.5 star only If I can. This app so worse and complicated to use. It's very sensitive about the security maybe and always got some problem, trouble, issue etc and ask us to go to bank, email the bank or call bank to fix it. Other bank is better because it's easy to use unlike this app. Always give us problem even though we use it politely
The previous version is much better than the latest one. The apps even cannot open anymore. Always lag and not responding. I even can't log in the account. This is upset cause i cant make any online transaction and check the bank account details.
Please fix and do something. I don't know what happened here. Every time I use this app, it shows the 'server error' on the screen 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
Unable to open the app. The app keeps loading for 5mins+. Cannot do any online transaction within the app.
When using scan qr function, there is no dot (.) when you want to make payment. So can't make payment if cents is involved.
If its possible, no star at all. Downloaded the apps because cannot continue with the transaction using the website, then the server keep on "unable to connect to server". U want people to use your apps, like PBe MAE, but then the apps is not working. How come? Many people comment already, no action taken meh? Very poor. Better no apps. Just back to the kampung style. Sigh
WORST APP EVER. Taking forever to load. If you still want to use 'ISLAM' as a brand, kindly improve the app to be more efficient and reliable. It is very embarrassing to see 'ISLAM' attached to a poor, terrible, and pathetic app.
Got an update, cant log in,.. reinstalling and after all registering it ask me to wait 12 hour, and when i do i still cant load the log in screen.. The biggest dissapoitment ever.
please do something bank in should be more easier. I tried to open this application for almost one day. it can be open.. can be impatient. It takes too long to open. Too many time to install unistall. On off the phone.. high traffic it's can't be related. Urgent transaction make a worse experience.
your team have make an improvement to the apps, much better and faster,please make it better. good job.
Edited as 28/11/22 : Only can login after new installation, and the same error still occur on the second,third,4th login you name it. APN_TSN_500 please fix that, or you guys seems working on new app ? Wanna to abandon this one really bad arent you? Edited as 7/8/23 : After a years away, decide to try the app back, now i can say its much better and no pop up error no more. But you are a big name companies, problem like this shouldnt take 1 years to be fixed. Change my ratings to 5 stars
After the update, now the application can be open smoothly without any stuttering or loading problem. Thank you developer!
This app request to update new version to open it but only load for so long and can't even open the app. So bad!!
Really bad comparing to last time. Before upgrading the security, using the TAC is just fine because I can proceed with my PC. But now it requires SecureLogin and then the app is lagging as hell + unable to load. What a waste of time
This is why I hate every single of Malaysia Apps, one of it because, too slow, yeah loading too slow, even sometime the app crash or error. How do you even create this app like a crxp? I want transfer or pay and sometimes the app have a problem, please improve your apps, you want a better rating, improve.. Not just replying and said tq for support and any problem pls report blah blah blah.. No, we don't wanna hear that, we just only want you to improve, that's it
One of the worst app ever. Why? Because you cant even open the app. They dont give you TAC number anymore to your mobile. You need to approve it from the app when you want to make the transaction. But how do i approve it if i CANT EVEN OPEN THE APP??? The worst app ever!!
The old version allowed me to make loan payment even it is joint account unlike this version. Need to make payment via web..so much trouble just to pay my housing loan. This new version also does not allow to take screenshot which I think will be much help to me when I make complaint (as attachment). Useless !
I have poor network condition in my area. When i wanna topup using mydigi. Then for the next step to approve transaction , i need to open apps to approve it. During the approval, the app cannot load due to poor network. After that incident, i cant open the apps because it always popup the approval for transaction then always popup error. What do i have to do to make the apps working properly? I have reinstalling the app but the issue is not yet solved.
Worst app ever. Entered the correct login details yet was blocked. To make it worse I cant even reset my password. It keep looping either at the same page or saying cant connect to server. Seriously, the worst app I have ever used. DO NOT INSTALL!!
It took too long to log in after latest update😠😠😠 After update to latest version,still it takes too long to log in even my phone is already operating in version 13
Dont know what is the problem always exceed limit when i want to make a transfer . Worst apps ever. Better dont have to use app.
Very bad, slow and the apps doesn't even open. Dah la urgent nak bayar student fee, apps pulak lambat tak boleh buka. Even dh uninstall and reinstall balik apps pun still tak boleh buka juga. Please fix the apps
Why it always pop out"can't connect to server" it always happens.it wasn't my connection it all about this app. Please fix em'. So annoying me.
So many issues with the apps. Need to install and uninstall so many times. Least favourite banking app.
Hi. Sorry for the review. Actually it is my mistake. After reading carefully, there are two type of app, 1 is GO, another 1 is GO BIZ. I install the GO BIZ and wondering why I cannot login. Turns out it is actually for business account, which I dont have. Then I install the correct one, which is GO, and I can login now and everything working fine. So I edit back my review and give the app 5 star as I'm very satisfied with the app sp far. Sorry again for the confusion.
just shut down the app if you guys can't handle it 🤷🏻 buat app simple simple sudahlah Fix your stupid app, the app always buffers when entering ALL THE TIME I HAVE TO WASTE MY TIME WAITING FOR THIS APP TO OPEN
Not really work during peak hours. As banking application, it should be able to support higher traffic especially during peak hours. It will be good if IT team can improve the apps ability to handle traffic
ISSUES ALL THE TIME, DELAYED IN OPENING THE APP. which is a huge problem when i wanted to make any transactions in store. Will move to other banks after this. Really bad service. Came back to edit my review, still bad. Much worse. I cant look at my transaction history, have to reload many times. When i say many, more than 10times. So yeah, I don't use the app anymore. I transfer all my salary from bank islam to my other bank straightway after receiving them 😤🤌
As usual this apps are never fail to disappoint me. I want to open it but its just freeze. I cannot log in it. The only successsful thing for this unreliable apps just to frust the users with its uses. Even before log in. The this apps is freeze. So as a compliment i congratulate the developers for developing this incompetent apps for the users.
This app can't working since a few months ago. I have try all methods that have been taught, but the problem is still remain unchanged. I'm using Redmi Note 9s which still Android Version 10. So I hope that this issue will be solve as soon as possible. Thank you.
If you all have issues with unable to connect the server, try uninstall and install it. Hope it helps!
i agree with everyone here. Worst app, slow, and hard to make transaction. stop replying with "we're sorry" and start making improvement. for the meanwhile let us just use the web and TAC instead like before. much easier. you want to make it more secure but the main problem is your apps are getting worst and worst. pleasela fix.
Please improve your service bank islam. This apps should be usefull for everyone cause nowadays everything can be manage by using phone. You're one of the best bank i think that i have use but your apps oh god please improve this! Do something!
Very useless and non-reliable application. Always stuck at the starting page. Have to install and reinstall to make it work, then after some time it will fail again. I don't know who Bank Islam appointed as the developer, including their IT team but they definately non competent and failed big time.
Worse ! Very frustrating! When I need to pay for online shopping, it needs to be authorised on the Go Bank Islam app. When I open the app, it takes a long time to load. After I enter the number and do it, even after the screen shows done, it doesn't pay for the items I need at the online shopping apps. Please improve these. When I deactivate my Go Secure and pay for my online shopping, it still wants to be authorised by the Go Bank Islam app. So, please improve this also. Thank you.
Alhamdulillah... GO by Bank Islam has gotten better since its downside recently and provided an improved online app banking experience for its users. It is functioning better than ever. Thank you very much Bank Islam!
The app keeps on loading in the front page, can't even log in. Very inconvenient. Needs to uninstall and install it back for thousand times cuz it keeps on crashing. Very not recommended when needed to use it in rush.
Why is it taking longer and longer to load the apps??? 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ Developer of this apps should fix it. It's inconvenient. Everytime I want to pay QR, I have to wait for hours. Most of the times I have to say sorry to the cashier and I have to waste my car's oil to go to the bank!!! What's the use of online banking if it is unusable???!!!!
Forever causing difficulties when needed. Forever high traffic, forever cannot procees, forever cannot read finger print & forever making me like a fool when need to pay or transfer at counters or shops. When call for report, the only answer u guys can give is still in the process of developing to give better experience. Nowadays, never have i ever had the experience of logging in only once to just to complete an easy task such as checking my balance. Must at least 3-6 tries before successfull
I am getting error unable to connect to server since the latest update. Such issue shouldn't happened for a banking app.
first time using this application, it went smoothly but the next log in, this app asks me to register again, but when I want to register, this app always can't perform, the answer is always given,"400 bad request","unable to connect the server"," high traffic","server error"...this app does not cooperate and cannot be used because it always asks to be registered...this app is not work ￼
Hi, please make the app very convenient because it really not helpful at all. To transfer or make a transaction, the loading are to long like there are no connection. The website version more convenient & fast than this app, even you successful to log in doesn't mean you transaction will make it on time. Don't link the web transaction confirmation to the app right now. Please bank islam I've being your customer since in college & now I'm 30 don't make it useless make it smooth & fast
The app is slow because it needs a strong Internet connection. That's all. Suggestion: 1. Update the UI app to more fresh one following the trend right now (Be U can, why the official app cannot right?) 2. Make a more friendly user UI, not old school one, bold & not interesting UI.
I don't understand why the app is getting worse after each updates. Online transaction can only be done/approve after approving it via app but app keeps on crashing and it said 'need to reinitiate new transaction'. When new transaction was initiate,the same thing occur again. Then it said new transaction can only be done after 12 hours. Kindly improve the app and fixed the bugs as I never encounter this issues with other bank's app.
Please make this app going faster and smoothly. It took me 10 minutes just for entering. Sometimes server busy and not responding ☺️. It is better using official website then the app. Feel too much irritated due to loading. Even after loading some of the transaction is late updated. And sometimes the available balance and current balance is not merge amount making me confused.
the system always slow went i want to used it to pay anything with qr and it keep say no connection but my line or connection are in good condition.
you gotta be kidding me- i've been using bank islam for a while now and tell me, why is there server error keeps happening every time despite i was having a really good internet connection, especially if i want to make IMPORTANT transaction????? i wish i can give zero stars for this app because it gets progressively worse over time and i see no improvements AT ALL for the past few years since i opened the account
Why the apps always out of server? It's kinda annoying when it happen! It's prevent from doing transaction! I hope you can fix it as soon as possible. It's always the connection problem. Why? Hope this will be fix!!!
Apps stuck hang! App still having the same problem. Loading to long, tried uninstall and installed back still facing the same problem year ago today still facing the same problem. What does this company do for improvement actually. Other banks already making it easier for customers but this company still no changes. Shame carrying up big name for bank name.
Very frustrating. Update, uninstall, reinstall, clear cache a few times still not working. Shud change to other bank now
Literally one of the worst banking app to ever exist. Don't even bother downloading. I'm on the latest update and the app seems to be stuck on that annoying "loading" screen whilst I'm on an important affair. It's 2023 and the app still has major performance issue. Not to mention the horrible UI design. Bank Islam needs to fire whoever is in-charge on maintaining this app.
SO SLOW THAT I CANNOT GET ANY PAYMENT DONE WITHIN TIME LIMIT. since they don't give TAC anymore, i have to approve payment through the go app but it takes forever to load the screen. one time i got a 20 minutes time limit to finish a payment. the whole 20 minutes. THE WHOLE 20 MINUTES. THE SCREEN WAS STILL LOADING. PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS IT MAY HAVE DISRUPTED SO MANY OF YOUR USERS' BUSINESS.
The most useless apps in the phone.not a friendly user apps since it's take too much time to open it (always shows high traffic volume while the user's internet connection are good..better upgrade your apps as soon as possible.
What the hell with your apps, it's getting worse day by day, i don't know what type of system that u've been used, it's seem so bad and always not function., Do something with your system, take a look and try at least to improve your system, i thought with apps more easy, but end up it's make me more miserable then before, you guys have to do something about that, try follow like maybank2u, more easy and friendly user..
STUPID APP!!!!!!! everytime server error, loading take a very long time. how to make online transactions if you cannot even go into the first page. it should be name as NO/CANNOT GO APP instead..better changing to other bank.
Please do something with this app. Transection cannot go smoothly. How many time have to uninstall and install back.
Please fix the loading issues on this app, I am restarting this app for 10 times and I still couldn't get through.
Frustrated. Almost every time i want to use the system always down. Please improve it.
Can I know why I use Celcom data(I don't test others brand data) cannot use Go Bank Islam? When I try using wifi, the app smoothly open which have no needed pending a very long time. I try watch yt on 1080p using a data, the speed is okey no slow. Please fix this horrible situation because I was on the hurry to use Go BI but can't open it. If something emergency I cannot rely much on this Go Bi. Other than that, please make bank islam look more user-friendly because it's hard to use.
Almost every time need to delete the app and relogin to access to the app. Pls fix the login problem.
I want to open the app, it takes a long time to load..then I want to transfer money, it loads again..then it is denied.. after that i must to delete the app, then download it again.. open the app, it loads again, then it is denied and I have to wait 12 hours to make the transfer.. the same thing happens over and over again.. please do something & improve your services..
Please USE MAYBANK M2U programmer to make this app better. Really hard to open, even to check my balance. When i want to make transfer, app showing error, but money already transferred. Very frustrated. This is about security & people money. Please making big change for ur banking system. Dont just keeps updating without any different. 0 star to u guys
The new online transaction where it requires this "very well made app" is such a great idea from them as I would need to face the buffering, 200 seconds when there's problem with the app, error 500, reinitiate the transaction and much more :). I had such a blast using this app!!!!:)))))))
Worst app ever. It is supposed to make things easier, but this app makes things harder. Always took a very longggggg time to launch, always high volume of traffic. Wasting so much time waiting this app to launch to make a single transaction.
It says wrong server, wrong connection then I uninstall & install the app again it become worse.. App keep loading.. Please do something..
Please fix this app ASAP, i've been uninstalling and installing this app countless time, everytime wanna use it, I can't even open it. It just keep on loading and doesn't let me ues it. Not only me, some of my friends and family face the same problem.
The most ridiculous bank app I've ever had to use. The thing just keeps loading for eternity on the welcome page! I can't even do online banking with my Bank Islam account because of this! WTH
TAKES TOO LONG TO LOAD. Please take action and fix this app. Making it difficult for users to pay and check the balance. It seems that not once or two users sound about this problem,but your party still does not make reforms and improve the problems faced by all of us.
THE WORST BANKING APPS EVER. This apps doesnt deserve any star at all. Very slow response. This problem has been addressed for so many times but it seems like there are no initiatives at all from the developers. If you dont want to improve your apps then dont bother create one. Will definitely switch to another bank
Need to get started after update. But after key in IAC number, it's loading until forever. Do it 3times but still same, even already received sms said done register go apps. Buying new phone to make sure using latest android version. Still same. Usually open in website. But right now want to have approval in go-secure. So, cannot do any transactions.
What is wrong with this app?! Its getting worse than the older version this is so time consuming. It keeps loading way longer than expected. I cant do my online transaction if this keep going on. Do something about this IT management or whoever in charge for this apps. Because this app is so disappointing.
Before the latest update i like this apps , smooth but after the update can't open the apps ' LOADINGGGGGGGGGGGGGĜGGGGGGGGGGG......plis fix this prob ASAP....TQ THE WORST BANK APPS SYSTEM I'VE EVER SEEN COMPARE TO OTHERS BANK APPS....
This app sucks, before this doesn't have any issue. Now after new updates i can't use it like before. The apps always crash, cannot log in, and now when doing transaction we need to use go secure and it need the apps to works in order to proceed but now the apps it self cannot open, then how i going to proceed with the payment?
Please disable the function which require customers to use this app for making transaction online, it cannot be use at all, especially when there is urgent need to transfer money. People may die somewhere because of this useless apps! I will consider to terminate my bank account if the issue still continue.
Very slow, difficult to open, please upgrade your service like other banks. Now I cant log in due to unable server🤬
App is so slow. Always have problem / Time Out while waiting for GoSecure to authorize fund transfer..
Bad. Everytime also cannot open. Always high volume. I need to uninstall and reinstall. Still cannot open. Lame. Now fully need to use gosecure what so ever, but to open, the apps still loading.
Previous is much better than new version or even worst.I could not do transfer after skip one time and pop up said it can be done after 12hr ??? What??? Bank islam please dont do this , you should be better with growing IT...
I think this is the 10th million times I had to uninstall and reinstall. Almost a year has passed and this still could not be resolved? It was such a nuisance when u have to do an urgent transfer but the gosecure couldn't be accessed as it took forever to load the page!!! Apa ni bank islam? Benda basic masih lagi sangkut?
worst app ever. so slow. always loading. it deserve 0 star. this problem has been happening or so long, was wondering if you ever want to improve this app?
Honestly I have no idea why I even bother still having the app, it is an effort in futility with how slow and the incomprehensible waiting time for it to open. It just like their management just want to be cursed by their users.
Very disappointed with the app. I don't know why I thought having all my money in this account would be useful. I've been trying to order my food online, and I couldn't do it as this app is not even turning on. I can't transfer in even from browsers. Haritu rasa macam dah okay sikit masalah ni, tetiba jadi balik. Tolonglaa be responsible with the app. It freaking holds our money, how should I believe this app if nak log in pon dah macam2 problem. Very embarrassing.
getting worse after the update. even a standard online banking would FORCE its user to open GoApp to authorise EVERY EFING transaction. This certainly causes unnecessary problem since I am the one who manage my family bank acc just from online transaction, totally away from home as a student. It it much easier before, but now, cannot anymore.
The app is worst! Only few times I can use my online banking without any problem, most of the time the server just doesn't seem to work. Nonsense! Please do something about this or else, do not have any apps at all.
I have updated the apps, but it is getting worse. I want to transfer to shopee, but fpx Bank Islam can't be used. Shopee history already stated as cancelled, but in the Bank Islam apps, the transfer is still reinitiated. After that, I can't open the apps because I keep mentioning "reinitiated transfer". Even after uninstall and install again, it still the same and can't be used.
this is the worst online banking app ever. It is always unusable. always under repair & log in takes a long time. I don't know what the problem is. every time I want to use it, I have to uninstall and reinstall it. please fix it. I can't stand it anymore.
It is good enough now. But still sometimes it will be stuck on the loading screen. Hope it can be better soon.
EDITED 25/6/23 : i thought it was getting better. Sadly, the smooth experience only last for 1 week. Now the apps is getting worst and slower than last time. Im planning on changing banking apps. 3 years and still no improvement. Please change your dev team / invest more on user exp.
Really bad experience. Too many times unresponsive, taking a lot of time loading and just now i can't even pay my bills because it has to be approved by unresponsive apps! You need to learn from Maybank or even MBSB, their apps are much better.
It don't work for open the apps n transaction. Please repair your apps!!! Why not allow to click apps this, aq geramm til lah baiki boleh tak?!
Good job, the application is better day by day. Keep improving, hope it'll be as good as it could be.
Already updated,but still have problem. cannot make a payment or transaction by using other apps
Selepas updated makin teruk loading dan over slow. Kenapa system apps bank islam menyusahkan pengguna? New prob APZ_TSN_500 unable to process your request. Still same when to open apps.
This app has been abysmally slow for the past months. It always fail to load past the circling loading animation. Not to mention my uni where i study use bank islam as main channel for financial services. But fortunately my uni has change to new RHB Bank. Please devs, fix your app ASAP. Update to dev : cache clear didnt help. I almost lose money when buying bus ticket using online banking bank islam. I was forced to use the app's Go Secure function yet the app fail to load past circle animation.
Previous version apps are more batter than current apps. After I updated to a new apps the apps seems having a bad issues. 1. It is hard to open, and it takes more time to open. Loading too long. 2. Even though1 managed to log in, when I choose, as an example, to transfer a money, the apps will be loaded again, and it takes a long time to load. 3. Not so friendly like before, because when I would like to check other things inside the apps, the same issue happens. Please make changes
It's faster than other bank's app that I've used. For now. BUT... I can't share the receipt nor can I screenshot them. When I clicked the share button, it's loading forever. It's troublesome.
It doesnt work lately. Infinite load screen, terrible lag. Its a shame becuz i really like the interface. Please keep performance in mind. Your web app works flawlessly, why the mobile app so bad?
The authorization thru the Go apps is really annoying, I only want to spend like rm20 thru fpx but I still need to authorize my transaction using the apps. I understand it will increase the security . But if the apps keep loading forever how can I even buy things online. I need to buy some food for my CAT!! AND THE APP KEEP LOADING FOREVER...MY CAT ARE DYING. WHY ARE YOU MAKING THIS HARDER FOR US 😭😭😭
This app keep getting worse every time I update. The "loading" getting longer whether still log in page or when I want to transfer. PLEASE FIX THIS. Supposedly when it updated, it getting better not otherwise.
I try to reinstall the app because its still in the loop mode for a long time. But after reinstall Ive to wait 12 hour to do duit now transfer. Instead trying to make it easier for us to do online transaction, it make we are keep waiting and harder to do online transaction. Such a nuisance!
Terrible app. Even ady update to version 3.2.10, even ady reinstall many times still cannot use the app.
The new update is really bad. If You want to transfer money, the app needed you to reconfirm in GO app, GO app took forever to load, in the meantime you have 180 seconds to confirm transaction through GO app thats still fail to load. I am really Disappointed. The worst experience ever.
Several problem occurred after recent update. Can't pay anything that need approval from apps and can't open the qr code
Slow connection. Unstable apps. Please improve for better performance. We are going for digital platform so need a better performance and easier for use.
Can not log in in the phone app. Keep loading. Very disappointed!!!!!!!
Poor services. Can't access apps due to high traffic, so need to use browser instead for transactions. Better use browsing rather than download this apps. Kindly test run the apps stability then only launch it.
I can't connect with this app. That's weird after updated. And always wanted update. Weirdo

very bad after update..everytime and everyday when i'm want to log in... still cannot log in and still everytime traffic issues..it's make me stress.. i like to throw my phone in the river everytime i log in this apps.... very2 stress... every time and everyday its very2 hard to log in... when it's really impportant to use.. but still cannot log in.. very bad apps right now. . after reinstall.. it's still cannot log in.. every minute traffic issue...its not good to use right now.. i hate this..
used to make online transfer from website but now it needs to get approve using the app but the apps is sooo slow. this is why I prefer using website rather than the apps. please fix it, I've been waiting for days and still to transfer my money from bank islam to another bank. don't make people's life hard, it's not good. so many complaints but nothing change.
Issues all the time, you will either face "unable to connect to server" or "high traffic" notice. Even though I have updated to the latest version and even reinstall the apps a few times, there's still no improvement whatsoever. Nonsensical. Update: if the app is only problematic for me, I may understand that I need to clear the cache or change to mobile data. But, when all the user are facing the same problem, it just shows that you have failed to provide a bare minimum for this app.

App becoming worst after the last update rolled out. Seriously slow, lagging, take long time for loading more than a minute, need to clear cache many times just to approve a transaction or get to login interface, and forever loading. Honest talk here, please do improve the apps. thank you
Very bad Apps. After updated, long long time for the loading. Please improve you Apps
Too bad.. took a veeerrrryyyy long time to access lots of hang, hard to trsfr. Bad apps.. need to improve more
Very unreliable apps , very hard to do transaction , i had to transfer all my money to other banks for better transaction procesess
the worst app ever. if your system cannot support the go secure feature, then better delete it. Just use the old tac method. Really wasting my time using this app. Need to go forth between this app and merchant app many time because the transaction cannot pass thru after the go secure step
It took so long to just open the app, keep loading, then after key in the password, need to wait again. Imagine if I use online banking payment, got long que in market, sure I'll get yell from other customers behind me. This is so slow. Bad experience. Needs to improve or I need to open new account bank and choose another bank instead (of course not Bank Islam no more)
I'm just give a single star because the process is too slow. And my money getting lost by itself without I use it. I'm not rich to sacrifice my single cents
Why keep saying to clear cache. How many times clear (lost counted) it still lagging and there's so many comments with same problem . Slow , lagging ,system down & bla.. bla..bla. Don't just respond to customers to convince them only, pls also solve the problem and find solution . Previously this apps not that worst .
can't open after updated the app,updated to the latest version (3 October 2023) still cannot open,android 12
Very slow for every loading pages, I wait for 5 minutes also nothing happen, please take this seriouly.
We know u trying your best to keep our fund save, but please if u guys always hold and updating the app for unreasonably period of time during peak weekends. It's no absolutely contengency plan from your side on how we need to dug our money for payment... Duhh... Maybe all BIMB branch is super high volume right now withdraw thier money manual for each payment.. if u guys not an expert in apps try hired some expert to do it right! It just took obvious.. too obvious... Same things always happen..
Response is slow as hell. While waiting for the loadings that appear everywhere in the app, I drove to Bank Islam (which is 30 minutes from my home) and performed the transaction. When I got home, it was still loading. Bravo to the developer.
Took lots time to make transaction. Sometimes failed to do it. Just loading...
"02-0005 INVALID CREDENTIAL"....I was locked out of my own account because the app always saying my credential is invalid even though it was fine when logged in via web. 🤬 Installed because the website forces to approve transaction via app, but the app says invalid credential. There should be a 'no' option because I hate the app. This app has major issue. 👎 Developer responds the same way as other critics in the review as if it was a bot replying. Google please take action and remove this app.
Worst ever apps. Lagging, loading, unable to ever enter the first page like 24/7. Apps should make life easier, but this is exactly the opposite way. Thanks to this apps, ill will never use Bank Islam again. Time to change to another stable bank.
Latest app version is super slow. Start to wonder if this app hasn't perform any performance test for the latest build. So frustrated. Cant perform txn coz stuck at splash screen when app launch.
Just please bring back the TAC no and no need GO secure for online transactions. It's suck when everything about the transaction need to go through the apps but the apps are so useless n loading. Why do you all doesn't have any backup plan for your customers? It's so annoying!
I think the previous App was better than now. Not only you cannot access the mobile app page, but when you want to make transfer of money, you need to access/get approval from the mobile app which cannot be accessed. How stupid it is....
Please do something, not reliable. Always facing 'non stop loading' when I want to tap for secure tac when transferring money
Very bad apps,very slow, couldnt ss.. too much time taken to be approved, managed.. hopefully you'll improve your system
pleasee repare the app . soo sloww . sometimes when im urgent wanted to transfer it takes so long to login
Cannot launching, sometimes meed to be wait. And the worst moment is when i need to make a transaction on web, they ask to approve by via app and the app cannot be open. So why do we need thiss app meanwhile it cannot be launching??? Please do something. It almost 3 years ive been used this and it still same like BEFORE
The worst bank I dealt with in my life: It doesn't work with my pixel 6, I can't even use my account on the website because ask me give approval on their app and app does not work.. what stupid poor service they doing, the email doesn't work also!! Plus many more other bad things....
Very Terrible. There's always something wrong with the server and traffic. Make it almost impossible for me to make any payment/money transfer. Annoying and took alot of time to recover. Sometimes, can't event get into the home page. Already uninstall and install the newest version but it become worst than i expected. Please make an improvement abt the app.
Very buggy and now i am unable to log in to my account due to it always stuck at the startup stating, "unable to connect to the server". While, some of my friends are able to use it like normal, but the other friends faced the same thing as me. Very slow in repairing it's bug and problem. Overall, it's disappointing to be honest.
After update the latest version, the apps seem having a lot of trouble..unable to do transaction smoothly.. cannot transfer money and taking more time loading and lastly it will logout suddently
I cannot login to approve my transactions from the web!!! Please fix the app!!! No more SMS TAC so your app is VERY important to function, login also not functioning!!! Update: Help was provided after contact and resolved my issue, bumped the rating stars for this
Please revert back the system to the old one. This new GO is a NO-GO. Not a user friendly at all. The apps keeps crashing and I cannot even log in to system properly.
Everytime update mesti bermasalah! Worst app ever!! Unfriendly, hassle and very irritating!! Transaction were all failed... menyusahkan hidup i! its been 3 days and in consecutive of everytime you all update the system!! What are you guys doing?! Takde usaha nak perbaiki masalah ni ke?! Shows your system and management terrible and weak!
Why this apps always problem? Either with wifi or data. Either bug or loading too long time, taking a very long time to open the apps, and many time 'under maintainence'. Already use this apps for more than 3 years. Please go for some improvements for this apps
2 days i cant log in. They say (unable to connect to server. Please fix this. Edit. ( now tabung haji cant open also).
Why this apps on 23rd until 10th every month can be used smoothly, always crash and need to reinstall back and set up all over again.. i have a bills to pay and i thought online banking are really helpfull my time.. but not on BIMB platform.. please fix this, i been using since 2018 until now same problem coming
Bank Islam app dosen't work at all. Everytime log in, it will take forever to load. The only way is to uninstall and re-install the app. Very inconvenient. In this age of online banking bank islam dont seem to be able to solve simple problem like this. Other banks have no issue on their apps. Very basic problems yet Bank Islam can't solve it. Dosent reflect the islamic or the banking status it deserve. Bank Islam customers are mostly B40 based that explains their typical "tidak apa" attitude.
What the function adding qr code scan system if opening the app take like whole hours to open and what the point to even exist if optimise too slow. Where the fund for the project to utilise and bring comfort and better and easy way if it keep failing us the customer. fixed you for sake of god app!
Unable to open at all most of the time, when u need to access account urgently, not a convinience place to save here
Getting worse. I'm using android ver 13. My internet line is 80-140 Mbps. I just bought new handphone. This is a global problem and not an isolated case. So why need any user that complain to contact the mobileapp when improvement has to be made at higher level. Don't be cheapskate and refused to invest for a better app developer
I can't do any transaction as they need an approval through the app..yet i can't even open the app. This is really frustrating. You should be aware that you've been receiving bad reviews the most. Hope you can fix this matter very soon!
I HATE THIS APPS SO MUCH!! I need to uninstall this apps for getting the secure LOL. Again and again. I am tried! PLEASE FIX IT! Learn from BSNsecure PLEASEE!!
Don't know how to say,but I'm really disappointed, because of this app, i rather like the old version cause it can access fast and quick, rather than this version, i know the future in this app are improving,but please improve the system also, worst
"unable to connect to server" this problem has occurred few months now. very troublesome. edit : after reinstall this app, I finally can use it as before. BUT, the loading screen before entering the password took FOREVER 😢 if any of you having the same issue, and you are reading this, please clear the app's cache. it makes the app smoother
I have been using the app for more than a year (maybe) and there have been massive improvements, kudos to the developers 👍🏻 I'm looking forward to future improvements especially in these 3 aspects - a more friendlier GUI (not too robot-ish please), a more complete/comprehensive transfer experience and frequent updates to fix the bugs. Additionally I have a question, the ability to add fav transfers is actually also not available on other banking apps, is it for security reasons?
First time login, masuk kan sms FA, error 500 Edit: switch lines & retry. Work like a charm. Edit2: everytime there's new update I have to key in password and set fingerprint setting again, this is stupid and wasting time. Please fired your app vendor!!!!!!!!!!!!!
the survey always have a problem, always be dragging my time, always crashing like everytime i wanna make a payment, what do you guys even doing? by just keep updating the app but the app are stil the same with the old problems? what a waste of time. All of the reviews from the users have been stating the same problem but nothing changed. Do your work properly by fixing the bug and so on. My connection doesn't have a problem but the app are just horrible. Do what you need to do. PLEASE FIX THIS
App updated. Unable to access service. Bad app. Response from admin also bad. Bank Islam get this sort out
I guess it is either the dev team is underpaid or you lots just plain idiot with no brain. Wasted half an hour just to make an instant transfer to another account. I don't wish you guys the dev team success. The Dev team doesn't deserve to be happy or successful in this world due to their "phenomenal" banking app. No improvements since the last 3-4 years. Lazy developers!
still loading and cannot open after restart phone,reinstall apps,nothing happen and still same
VERY BAD experience. The switching between the acc is so not user-friendly. And now I have a problem to access my company acc because of "invalid credential". I need an urgent transfer and now THIS. If you want to make every transfer more secure by doing this, please make sure the app is good-enough. I hope to see the improvements. Pleasseee...
Very slow to do online transfer. Hard to get SecureID page
I can't log-in to the app using my new phone. I have been installing and uninstalling the app for many time but the problem keep on going. Whenever I try to log-in, the app suddenly close. Like when i fill up my bank id and it started loading then the app close and it went back to my phone homepage. I tried many time and I nearly reach to the final step, but it still suddenly close. Please solve this problem quickly cause it is inconvenience to make a transactions thru the website. Thank you.
Seriously..just go back using pin number..using this app to confirm every purchase is nightmare..
Why when using online banking from web browser quite fast, but thru app can't connect to the login? Using different server or the app's connectivity very bad? Please fix it as some transaction need to go through Go Bank app.
I dont even know what happening with this app anymore. i cant even open the apps and used it to pay online. It said server error continuously. Everytime i need to pay online i have to open this app and approve the payment but this app didnt work at all. Let me just use TAC if this app have a problem .this is worst.
Worst apps...always loading...I can't use online transfer just because must validate by this apps... in the end still to use old system go to ATM and transfer via machine
recently using this app is difficult and unpleasant, since it takes too long to open and also frequently not responding. very frustrating since i cant settle my bills and payment as planned.
Suck and hard to get access. When require fast transaction in any store it make it headache. From 2016 until now doesnt have much improvement by BIMB. Really disappointed on failure of management team BIMB.
Please improved the apps for better experience..regret to use it as my main bank transaction...anything related on online payment so lembap bapak lahh..link with go transactions not sync, pending and transaction will be invalid..did not sure amount transaction were deducted or not..to open apps / using qr paid kena sidai macam hape.bende laa bank apps mcam ni.letihlaa...
apps yg sgt tidak membantu,nak log in pon susa,x dpt..buffer..pakai chrome ok je log in..tp x guna gak klau pki chrome nk buat approval kne log in apps gk..benda ni da lama x de improvement pon..please la BIMB learn from others bank apps such as HLB very effsien n convenient..
Always error, dont create app if always be like this,.. need to open website everytime.. From IOS to Android still facing the same problem. Poor technical system
App is not working at all. It keeps showing the loading icon. Thanks to not working I am unable to approve transfers when using rhe website instead
I got error all the time went to sign in... I need to uninstall and install again.. And it will be the same.. The application take more time then last version...
It's always says cannot connect to server. I cannot use this app at all. Please improve your app or i should change my bank soon.
New version has better than previous version. Good improvement for Bank Islam. Proceed with tagline 'Assuring Trust. Delivering Value'.
Shouldn't have given a star. First of all this is inconvenient at all. The website is much more better. I'm trying to do a single transaction over days but still can't. Go to 'Go secure' put in the digits still NOTHING. The needs to log in everytime and then the apps log out suddenly when making transaction so irritating. Plus the 'not valid' when literally just a second after log in. A single transaction but this much troubles is so frustrating. It's making me lost temper everytime.
It is definitely the slowest bank application in Malaysia. I have Maybank, Standard Chartered, Public Bank, UOB, Alliance, OCBC application in my phone. Bank Islam easily the winner in this category. Keep up the good work although I highly doubt that any other bank will be able to defeat you in term of buggy and laggy.
Really bad experience with this apps, always hanging..round and round but not appear. Want to do online, ask to use this apps but always fail..
Loading slow, cant do transaction without it. So much for security when u cant even do a simple transaction
Garbage app, keep getting "Server Error, unable to connect". The website was working fine before and now you need the app to approve duitnow transfers. Why fix thing that was not broken? When you are able to actually access your account, navigation within the app is also sluggish and slow. It takes forever to just do a simple transfer. Seriously considering closing my bank islam account and migrate to a better service.
so bad. took too long to login even when not on payday. maybank2u is much better. how logically could u think that it keep saying high traffic whenever i tried to login while my friends could easily login. i am sure that this is not about phone issue
The worst worst worst worst bank apps ever!!!!!! Take forever to load even though the wifi signal is good.. The web server is better than this stupid apps!!! But the web server is not that good also!!!!
Where is the menu to view transaction signing? Adding or deleting favorite accounts has become difficult! If you click on the Transaction Signing notification bar while using the apps, it won't redirect to the correct page to approve the transaction. And there is no way to view the current Transaction Signing! Inbox messages cannot be clicked too! Disappointing! This apps is only good to view the current balance, that's all!
Not supposed to be any star. The worst app ever. Not user friendly, not worth having it. I can't even make any transaction via online or the app. If not 'no service' its either 'error' for whatever reason. Worst of all it say session exp. Like what the F!! I just open the thing like few seconds ago. Keep logout for no reason too. It was easier before if I need to pay immediately or for emergency now it take almost a whole day just to make 1 transaction.
Very poor apps. Once installed, tried to sign in a few times. Each time it says server problem. Finally was able to sign in. But the balance shown is zero which is impossible coz the would definitely ask me to close the account. Tried again later. Same thing. Zero balance. So decided to uninstall. Please look at other banks app especially maybank. It's much more friendlier.
No offense, I know it is the goverment orders to use secure2u in mobile apps for verification relating to any online payments but you gotta fix the unstable problems of your mobile apps as soon as possible, guys. It's hindering day to day operations.
As i using it,this apps become more stable and smooth than before, keep it up 🤗
I rated 1 star in 2019 (deleted) and i can now attest that Go has made so much improvements. Go, you deserve 5 stars.
Takes forever to load, very slow, please fix the loading time issue
Apps keep stuck before login page. Your apps and server is made up of a potato or what?
very baddddd. always cannot open. always server error!
So inconvenience. Lag almost all the time. Please please please improve this app
The apps enlighten my routine. Its futuristic and fast.
Why during Im buying foods you decided to be unavailable its hard yk I need the money seriously can you hurry up I need to use the card seriously I couldn't even pay for the food bc of the maintenance
The apps is always unable to connect to the server
Easy to use even for beginner with appropriate button function
Straightforward to use and app has been improving over time!
take so much time just to check my balance, it keeps giving server error😌
Very lousy apps. I think lot of people already acknowledged the issue so i have nothing more to say
too bad, always need to update, poor servers .
Am having trouble downloading mobile transaction receipt, whereby nothing is downloaded.. its blank if share!!!
Loading takes forever using Redmi note 11s but run smoothly on redmi note 11 pro 5g.
I found that the latest fixes/releases makes this apps better and user friendly
Hire someone can fix this apps asapla. Aiyoo. Big company but loading time never improve.
An annoying incompetent app. I can't even get to the log in page, it just keeps on uselessly loading for eternity. The most infuriating thing is that every transaction needs GO authorization, so I'm just here unable to pay my student debt for months. If you're going to make it so important at least make it usable at the very least. FIX IT.
Frequently lags. Loading to log in page very slow. Overall not very secure.
This app is a way for the bank itself to scam its patrons. With how the bank forces patrons to use this non-functioning app to make any transfers. Its best to just close the account and go to another bank.
Worst apps ever. They keep loading all the time. However, I can smoothly use the other bank apps, so it's not an issue with my internet connection. I had no problems when using Chrome for bank Islam Internet banking
Hire some better developers. Super slow app, assuming it's actually loading at all
Still worse after update on latest version. Lag, didnt show account history, qr pun loading, disarankan bertukar ke bank lain
UX is good enough but need some improvement. Eg, the fingerprint approval for duit now. After logged in to the system with finger print must have approval again but of on main menu no need. Wierd isn't it? Overall, the app was good but feels unpolished and inconsistent. Maybe can ask for more budget for app development next time. If development is on the way then can wait to try.
I can't open up the apps .. how i'm gonna make transaction? 😭 i already update to the latest One
Not so convenience to use for the waiting time. Need to always update.
Please hire someone that really good in IT. So, your user can using this app easily and more faster like a cheetah. Your apps now is almost being near with useless. PLEASE FIX IT!! FIX IT!! FIX IT!!
Still bad service...slow maintenance...I can't even do anything through website or application
Worst mobile banking app ever, slow and sometimes just does not work. If in an emergency the person would have died waiting for the app to start.
I dont understand why the apps is slow. I'd rather doing the online banking using google chrome. It is faster compared to the apps itself. I hope Bank Islam will address this issue as soon as possible
Too slow to open, missed my transaction. Latest app version.
Already update to the newest update but still cant access to this app...unistall and install back to the newest version but still cant log in...what should i do? Dump the phone or the bank?
The Go app sooo slow n not responsive in good time. Its take too long for app to activate..its not help for urgent matter when to used it.
I thought making an app should ease the users, not make it more difficult. Its annoying that every time the app has an issue need to uninstall and reinstall back app or update it, and bimb doesn't send notification on updates of the app or app issue so its really hard to know what's the problem. The website page is much more easier to use compare to the app.
I don't know what's wrong with this app,every time I try to login,it don't allow me to do so..I already put the right password,but still it didn't work out..and always lag,hope so it soon will be fix..
Can't even open smh.. Alr update, now can open but cannot log in..
the worst, tak pernah dapat bukak. selalu server error. please fix this issue
It's really frustrating that lately it's taking so damn long to load the app.. at first i though it was a problem with my internet connection but all of my friends that are using this app also experience the same thing.. idk what's wrong with the system but please fix it.. it's hard to use cashless payment method if it's always taking so long to load like this..
When we r already at the cashier and the apps dont even work. There and then we tried to uninstal n reinstal.. but sometimes it wont work also after reinstall 🥲
Why do i need to verify at GO apps if app itself can't even function properly? I can't pay my semester fee!!!!
Really great to whomever force this app of any transaction. Who's idea would great enough to forcely link any transaction with an app so buggy. Bring back message code! This app is not suitable for older phone!!!
Bagus. The banking app has been improved a lot! Thanks!
the longer it takes to open the app.. the slower it gets...it's always loading why ahh??
Why the app is so slow? When I opened the app, the loading animation will play like forever. Can't access the app at all. I have already cleared the cache, I have cleared the data, didn't work. I have uninstalled and installed the app again, worked but only the first time login. Next time I want to login this thing happened again. The app used to work properly now what happened? It has been like this since middle of last year. Were there no fix?
The app is slow and always loading and failed to enter. Everytime i want to make transaction, i need to uninstall and reinstall the app. Can you do something about this? It's such a hassle to uninstall and reinstall every single time when i need to do transaction. Update based on reply by admin : I have never experience this problem with other bank app. I don't have to clear cache to enter any other bank app.
I've been having issues logging in since 3weeks now, been reinstalling the apps many times but the same problems keep showed up "couldn't connect to the server" "high network trafficking, too many users" bla3. But even up until today, the app wont fix. It was working perfectly fine before the update, now it has become haywire & I can't do cashless transactions no more. Pls fix the app ASAP developer?!
the apps doesnt work even after reinstallation. it got stucked at loading page
Terrible app despite it being finance app. They should be 0 error making this app, my friend didn't receive the RM200 i sent
problem transfer to tabung haji. please fix. and app to slow when to login compare maybank & cimb.
I don't know why in android cannot use and shows try again server error but with Iphone its working.Please fix this because it's hard to do transaction using bank islam since I have to approve using secure Go
Lagged too many times, despite updates on android. Please do something.
Why take too much time to login! Not easy to access. Very bad apps

I actually wanted to give this app five stars, but after seeing the rating which is 1.3...then I decided to give 1 star...in simple words, I want to set the rating to always be 1...AHAHAHAHAH 🤣🤣 poor "bank islam".
Always server error, external not responding idk why this apps become so suck after update and update,
Every time to open the apps always be loading until infiniti.. Hurmm
Unable to connect to server..Go version 3.2.10 and android 10.
Could you separate your ATM locations and branch locations because the branch locator is mixed up with ATM locations. I want to search for a branch.
So slow loading..keep trying to open the apps. N loading...

Apps cannot log in..it makes problem..wanna trasfer online cannot log in..
If I can give Half star. I will. Alway keep me waiting too long, Loading and loading.
if theres a zero star review i would give it to this app...Like seriously?...Why do you need to make a payment everytime we need to go through the app? its stupid and slow
Why when i open this app, an error 500 appears. Please solve this issue as soon as possible
Suddenly show a server network error and even after reinstall the app, its good for a few hours then the same thing happen again. Fix this thing
After a new update this week it seems even worst than previous, Cant even open always loading
Pls fix ur server or whtever issue it is. I hve experiencing ths issue since ths early 2023 n i have limited patience. I hve been considering changing my bank acc bcos of ths apps
da update.. tapi apa yg lambat sgt nk bukaknya..yg lama lagi better than new veraion.. take so long to. open.. disappointed betul dgn isu apps bank islam ni
Apps very slow..please do apps fast..very very very disappointed..
The worst banking app in Malaysia I've used. Everything loads up very poorly. You want to pay some stuff at the store using qr? Well, you'd die of old age first. Even the Bank Islam website sucks. People that uses this intentionally are masochists.
New apps so sucks.. Make me stress to use it.. Waiting so long and still loading...
App doesnt do anything (almost all time i used it)! DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING IF IT IS NOT BROKEN!
The app getting improvements with user-friendly functions.
Whoever in charge with developing this app should resign, not competent at all, most of the time not working
Among the dumbest feature with this apps is they didnt let me screen shot due to privacy policy THIS JUST REALLY EXTREMELY BOTHERING ME, I CANT SHARE MY PAYMENT PROOF BECAUSE I FORGOT TO SHARE THE PDF FILE AFTER I PAID MY SELLER AND I PROCEED TO HOME SCREEN END UP CANT TAKE SCREENSHOT ANYWHERE WITHIN THE APPS? WHY CIMB APPS DIDNT DO THIS? SO WHY WOULD YOU?
After update cannot open the apps until today.Pervious apps more better.
Apps always lagging, some times not responsed, please solve the problem a.s.a.p
Took long time to load, please fix for most Android device
The apps keep loading and unable to login.
So slow to open this app, hopefully this problem will be solve in tge future.
Your rating now 1.3..only 1 star..probably ending with no star if playstore allow us... each time update your apps keep freezing... stuck at loading page..do something.. look at your competitor..maybank..cimb...all good
As of now (6/11/23 11.51pm) the app stays on loading page. Tried with different type of internet connection but it's still loading. Didn't have any issues through bimb webpage. Only the app. Already tried to restart the phone and open the app again though. P. S: after reading all the recent reviews, makes me wonder, does the latest version of the app is still very bad?
Been using this app for years and it was smooth. But after recent update, it just went from good to worst! Whenever i tried to login, keep on pop-up 'unable to reach server'. Super annoying! Then i uninstall and re-install, looks fine but when i keyin my ic number, it detect as error. U guys please fix it asap.
Keep crashing and unable to connect to server
the latest version for bank islam is so disappointed. it make hard to the late version of phone to be install that application especially for the older one . is it the best that you can do for the people who was using ur application ? if this keep happening, it's only make people to choose another bank 😤
Bank islam service didn't improve their log in apps delay even few years. Very bad
Slow , Cannot do any transfactions. Then its better after the comments
Trash app. Can't even load the login page
App paling useless. Susah nk access, loading then lastly tak boleh nk buka pun.
For the 4th time I'm writing this review until the dev team can fix the bug. So here goes, I got stucked at the loading screen even when I'm connected to the internet. After loading, it goes to the 'good afternoon' page, it was a blank page, no button or whatsoever, got stucked there. Uninstall the app and installed it again, same thing happened. I can conclude this app is non functinal and utterly useless. Step up your game and learn from MAE ;)
What wrong with your apps recently? After updating the system suddenly i cannot open it at all?!?! Fix it faster please. This issue have not being fixed even after more than 1 week. Dissapointing. It have been very convenient to use it past few years but not anymore. I can't even open it now!
Previous version is better..i cannot see my balance in TH after the update
The worst ever. Install uninstall for three times. Still cannot open the apps. Better dont have the apps if its can't be open or lagging all the time.
Fix the bugs and improve the server.
Love this apps. Easy and convenience to access. Go Bank Islam dah BETTER. Alhamdulillah.
This app is extremely terrible, shame on the developers for not fixing it. Might as well use other alternatives than this slowpoke.
Terrible. It used to be the most handy app for transactions. Now i can't even get through the login page. What happened BIMB?? Apps are supposed to make online banking easier but this is the other way around. It has been going on for months now eversince the most recent update. Would very much appreciate if your team can find the problem and fix it asap!
App always hang and I need to always reset the ibanking because for some reason, they keep telling me I got the credentials wrong. Resetting password is also another issue and always in circles. End up with the issue not resolved. Overall disappointed with the app, the website is more or less the same as well. Only a matter of time for me to close my BIMB account.
Always unable to access into this apps with error msg appeared as "due to high traffic". I suppose the bank should be happy and expecting the high traffic as the mark of trust from the user. Please fix it.. to be honest, both apps and website version. I have headache with both today, and customer service always unreachable due to the high numbers of call.
Why is it that everytime on salary day, I can't open the app? I had to uninstall & install again. It just get annoying because I need to set up again from the start. The app itself is easy too use, so i wish this would be resolved quickly. Edit (3 May): The developer response to my email regarding my issue pretty quickly, even tho I email them late at night... So, kudos. Improve my rating. Still cannot actually give 5 star la cuz still not perfect.
Always experiencing failed transactions when I start to use this Go App system. I really don't like it. Not convenient to use it. It's better for not using this system. I think I should use other bank.
The most irritating online banking app. Now need to approve in bank Islam Go for online transaction, while I cannot even access to the app. Gosh need to do something about it. Always unavailable. So not helpful at all.
This app really make my business even worse. Take a really long time to loading which I need to delay my important transaction just to wait it loading. The server always error. Really hard to go with this app.
App is laggy and full of error. I have uninstalled and reinstalled. But still cannot open the app. It stated that error 500. Please do something! I cannot transfer my money online because the approval need to be done on apps
Very unfriendly user. Takes a very long time to load. Unexpected time to make a maintenance and everything bad combine in one app
How did you managed to mess it up? it was doing fine before. right now its just impossible to even log into the app. loads forever and suddenly system is currently unavailable.
Super slow after updates, login, transaction ,then after finish transfer ,it log out ,then try to login again, access denied. Done reinstall. Still problem occur .please check .
The previous one i think much better. The new version i cant even log in, it just keep on loading and loading 🙂 please fix the issue.
As a student using bank islam is really difficult.Because most off the time this app is not working properly.if we want to top up or transfer the money it's really hard for us. Most of the time this app is not working properly....
Previous version much better than new update. To Developer this app supposed to help user & enhanced ur security not give burden on them. Manager, Sales, Pre-Sales, Marketing & Developer please improved your application before we change to used other services. Thank you.
This apps was performing from normal to bad . Now going from bad to worse. Please do something. Upgrade it, make it faster and don't forget about improving it's safety features.
VERY VERY BAD!!!! WHY THE SYSTEM IS VERY SLOW UNLIKE MAYBANK. Bfr this, I can buy the ticket without need to download the go bank Islam apps. But today suddenly I must use the app to settle the payment. This app is very bad & please do not trouble us as the bank Islam users with your bad system.
I have to wait so long before i can make transaction. Please improve. Sometimes, i can't even open this apps if i have some emergency transaction. Please improve this apps. Don't make it worse!. Please.
I can't even open the apps after the update! Worst banking apps ever. It make the transactions more difficult/ almost impossible!!!
Before this the app is just okay, but yesterday an error message keeps popping up and wouldn't disappear and I cannot make any transactions using Bank Islam. I have Deleted the app yesterday.
Very slow. Please improve your app. After all these years of update, transaction become worsed as you still need to open the apps even using web biz page. Very unprofessional of handling customer complaints. Shameful
This app so problematic, try to login since yesterday and still its loading though I have good internet. I couldn't make any payments. Even CIMB I can login with 512 kbs when I'm run out of data.
Slowest apps to be honest..Please take your users opinion for better result..We suffer more than anyone everytime we try to make transition,transfer and everything..Please make sure your apps run more smoothly..TQ
I wanted to do the transaction request from other app, then it asked me to redirect to this app to continue the transaction. But when i opened this app, it suddenly said "please reinitiate the transaction" and the app stuck with that popup window.
Always high volume of traffic. Not ideal for emergency. Loading time takes too long. Need more than 10 minutes just to load up QR.
So far the slowest mobile Internet banking app i ever used..still can't open the apps after 10 minutes waiting.. Affect my payment / transfer every month.. Bank islam should have assess again this apps.. Using website is better, but still need secure number from apps..
I want to online transfer, but due to apps server error, i need to wait until it's okay. No option like TAC or other if something happen like this. Poor apps.
It was easy navigation & functioning really good before, but now just to log in I have to try 3-4 times, then after log in, to do transaction also it keeps on loading until the session expired. Is it safe anymore. Please do something, before I change my banks. Dont ask me to make a report again, just read this & do something quick. Bank should be reliable & secure!!
I'm sorry but please please please hire someone who can really do the jobs right. Why this app always laggy and buggy.. why it keeps reloading... how many times do I have to keep key in the information.. so not user friendly
too bad when opening his apps, always loading. why is this happening? his service is too bad. It's really hard for me to transfer money to other people because it's hard to open their apps, just load them Please take immediate action.tq
Trash apps, sorry for the harsh word but come on Bank Islam? Already 2021 but still with this kind of apps. Hardly stable to use. People use mobile apps for convenience not to get more headache haiya. Update : 2023 still trash. Both website and mobile apps cannot be used at all. Don't bother using Bank Islam anymore
Bila nak upgrade apps ni? Basic function pun tak tercapai. Duk loading memanjang. Malu la sikit dengan apps Maybank. Contohi apps mereka. . Update: developer noob. Cannot provide even the basic function of the apps
Can't open the app for so long. How to transfer my money?? Even when i'm trying to topup my shopee pay, I cant use this bank because I need to open the app to authorize the transaction. Please improve asap 😠
I was using bank Islam website to transfer but couldnt and the website told me to download the apps. Now i cant even login the apps because there is error popup. The worst apps, service and a waste of time.
The slowest apps that universe can handle. I think, it is faster to go to the bank, take a number and que at the counter just to know my account balance than waiting this app to load.
Apps always problem and slow response. Its not convenient if you are in a hurry. This is the worse banking app period.!
(Edited) Now, the app navigation seems ok for me. So i add 2 star more from my original 1 star review before. Also, for not be able to see my transactions history pains me. So no more star for you for now
Update your system properly. What's the use of keep updating but the outcome got worse. Ugh if it's not for my uni i would never use this trashy app. BANK ISLAM PLEASE IMPROVE YOUR SYSTEM. THE PROBLEM HAS ONGOING FOR SO LONG BUT THERE'S NO ACTION TAKEN? WORST BANKING APP EVER
Slow when open the app and even slower when opened using mobile data. Please fix it ASAP, a lot of people using duitnow and online banking for everyday transaction.
Worst app ever. Might consider to change to other banks if you don't improve / upgrade your apps. Update on 25/6/23: still cannot use. Don't bother to download this app. USELESS
Too Slow and unstable. Its year 2023. Even a 'Car Wash' business has an apps now. Your internal budget for online banking apps and marketing must have been gone to somewhere else,i predict. Lastly, 'Riba' is haram😁
Very bad system. Doing the transaction online always on lag i can die because of this system makes my food transaction always failed. Shame on you.
I don't know what happened but it seems I can't log in into my account, is it under maintenance? Because it always log out when I'm login. Hard for me to make transaction
Please improve your system. Seriously so stress when people using to play. 1st thing is the GO app. No need actually when we using OTP. Then always system is currently not available. My God seriously so stressed. improve improve improve please🙏🏽
i want to review without giving A star actually. This app always bug . if i uninstall and install back, i have to wait another 12 hours so i can use the transfer method and others . what a problematic app . VERY TROUBLESOME .
The apps keep on loading until time to do transactions out. Worst banking apps ever.. I had to go to the bank to do it manually..
Really disappointing with the BANK ISLAM application, it should be easier for every customer when they want to make an online transaction, there must be a problem, please fix it don't waste the customer's time many times have faced this problem very disappointing.
Worst bank app. Most of the time cannot login, high traffic error, lag & slow. I will rate 0 star if given the option.
Bad service ever, i wanted to login but keep denying even though already put the right password, then i have to wait within 12 hours before i can proceed for any payment after change the password, please make sure to update this thing
the most retarded app on planet, how could this app still exists at this moment. even a snail would be faster than this app, and whose idea was it to confirm the online purchase through this stupid app and thought it would be a great idea when it is slow as hell ?
Always error opening the app. Showing high traffic everytime !!! How to confir. TAC if app always crash ?? Shame lah u manage this app. 😡😡
Trying to open the apps but got an issues on the server, tried to uninstall it but until today its failed, please resolve this issues ASAP (15/12/22). UNTIL TODAY THIS IS ISSUES IS NOT RESOLVE (02/08/23)
I do not know why the app so lagging. This really affect my transactions for biz. Have to restart over and over end up using on the web to transfer.
Apps is SOOOO problematic. HAVE TO REACTIVATE QR CODE FOR EVERY.SINGLE.USE??!! LOAD TIME?FOREVER EVEN WITH WIFI😑 you update the apps but nothing happens 😩
The worst app i have been used. Update , update, update but nothing improve. Each transaction (above limit) need to approve by app, but cannot open to approve. So HOW? Really annoyed. Does not deserve even for 1 star. Shd be 0.
Please acknowledge all the reviews you received. This apps received 1 star for most of the ratings and bad feedbacks but still no improvement from the admin. Please do something and improve your apps. This apps just make things harder. Even 1 star is over rating.
I couldn't even open up the apps, such a bummer! I need to do instant transfer, but the apps didn't help at all. Do better with the apps Bank Islam..
It takes too long to loading.. And the apps crashed frequently.. it makes it hard to get approval for duitnow system..
Worst application ever. The application should be more easier but became more harder. Cannot use the application at all. I even cannot pay my bill.
Downloaded it for the first time today and all I get is "Server Error: Unable to connect to the server". What a waste of time. Not going to bother trying it later in the future if it can't even function.
Please bank Islam improve your application. It takes time to open and sometimes there have many errors.. It's easy to use but the loading and errors make me annoyed.
Please fire all of your swqa and dev team and management , lots of bugs in this app slow loading time, lots of items in app dissappearing reappearing randomly
Previous version much better. Current version always lagging & it is troublesome when i want to use it urgently. Hopefully BIMB can do something.
Recevied error message "Reach maximun of user id". After de-listed user and add new user. Please fix this issue. I believe this is only minor issue.
Lembap gile app ni...nak open app took very long period that I can made coffee baru bole bukak... sometimes the app cannot open cause having inconvenient problem... developer please improve this damn app and fix the problem...other bank apps work smoothly but this app work very dull
Too many error. From log in up to transferring fund. Please fix the apps, or just remove it from apps store if u are not going to fix it
Cannot even start the app, now online banking through regular web cannot perform online transaction, what other option the user has for online transaction then? Please fix the app. Thank you
Cant even access the apps..transfer through website but it to go to the apps to be able to transfer..but everytime i want to access cant even enter the apps..the apps always problem..
The current version is take time to open compared to old version. It's really annoyed. Please upgrade the system.
Very slow apps, difficult to do online transaction (always received error), cannot use screenshot for proof of payment use, always received error so many times, very bad apps...
Not even worth of one star. Slow, sluggish. Login using fingerprint will fail most of the time.
This app is really terrible. It's always have problems and when you enter the app, it's take too much time to load. Mybank app is better in my opinion.
cant login. the same id and password were use in desktop,but keep on sying "invlid credential" in apps. i cant transfer money as the desktop online bankin ask to install this app to setup something at its setting. now useless.
Hello Bank Islam, what kind of improve if your apps always stuck and loading? Really troubling the user. The most trouble apps bank that i used, sorry not gonna used this apps anymore, you guys never take this as lesson. Bye forever and ever !!
Just updated today and your app just gave me an "Error 500" What does that mean and I've tried uninstall and reinstall a couple of times but it still gives me that error code 500.. please help!
Been using the apps but lately the apps become suck. Super snail and giving a fuss to the customers. Please do something fast or ur going to loose a lot of customers
Very bad experience with this app, please upgrade your system. Poor, incompetent, waste of time, awful at the every corner...
Why got problem when to open ? The app want loading until when ?? Until I have child or i die ? I can't to make payment ! It's so very double triple bad !! Very and very triple disappointed !!!
The apps took time for every process even log in also take too long . Very dissapointed . Sometime its very hard to make money transfer 👎
Worst working apps. That's I can conclude about this apps..unable to connect to server, traffic bla bla bla. So frustrated.
Bad interface and the worst of all, the line and the online services of the app is barely bearable at most. 0 star.
Apps got lots of prob during startup. Reinstall and its gna deauthorize ir registered phone when all u want is to use back. Trash quality.
The bank fund did not reflect the amount I have in my account. When open via website, it shows the amount. But in the app only show zero ringgit.
This is most worst bank app in Malaysia. I wonder why Uitm compulsory for student to use Bank Islam as main student bank account?. App very slow, always show loading bubble, I'm unable to log in to app. Bank Islam you are multimillion company, you are supposedly able to upgrade and fix app without problem. New update: I'm done!!!. Time to close Bank Islam account or let's account became dormant. I'm suggest user closed account and change to Maybank MAE and Cimb Octo or transfer to TNG E-wallet.
This app has been the lousiest since from the beginning. I hope the team will rectify the issue. Everytime error!
Transaction error error error error error non stop. Seriously noob, super useless especially TAC, making functional apps and services super trash. Just fired whoever team that development this apps.
Not deserve a star at all. BIMB need to do drastically changes to make sure this app functionally correctly. Else, it will leads to customer loss to other conventional bank services.
Take a long time to just load the screen. For what forcing us to stop using the website and use the apps . Seriously ? Not convenience
This stupid thing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!@@×!×@!×+I can't load to the app. It's says cannot connect to server. Have been trying many times, still failed 😔
Slow and laggy..almost every time cant sign in..need to relaunch the app several times.. tonight issue "cant connect to server".
App Server always shows a slow as a snail app's navigation. Kindly check the server in case of hacker intrusion.
The apps cannot open or even to register. Also, you need to open the apps for approval transaction even you are doing money transfer through website.stupid application.
Bro..seriously, i am in urgent to do the transaction and the apps keep on crashing. Open by browser, and need to confirm transaction by using this apps. Seriously?
Forced to install to enable online transfer. Installed, went through all the stupid steps, logged me off multiple times. 2 hours in I still can't do anything. Modern day robbery.
The login part kinda slow while waiting for loading. Sometimes, it freezes and crashed.
Disappointed!! The worse apps in my phone. Eventhough Im using browser, i still need to authorised my transaction through this apps. The problem is i can't even open it. Shame on you bank islam.
not even worth 1 star. just like other reviewer, the app is now worse after the update. Loading takes forever, online transaction took so long despite having fast internet. Lagi update lagi teruk hmmm
Poor app. Not go for user friendly. Not easy to access. Unable to connect the server 😞😞😞
Very slow app, it take a long time just to open the app and most of the time i cannot access the app at all.
Its sincerely getting worse!! Its keep loading without getting anywhere. Please fix this asap.. Ppl use it everyday.. If we just open it for it to be loading, then what the point???
Bank Islam Go is testing my patience. Banyak kena istighfar, banyak kena ingat kepada Allah because when you need to open the app, you can't because of high volume or because they're experiencing technical issues. Fix the app, Bank Islam, once and for good.
Worst experience ever. Loading takes forever. Simple assignment cannot be done. Plan your schedule weeks ahead or just accept that nothing can be done through this app
Looking forward for better online service. This apps too slow for loading and frequent error issue on server.
Very very bad services. Apps cannot be open and seldomly successful to make transaction. Hoping there will be improvement in near future
Please upgrade your apps, hard to access. Sometimes need to wait loading for long time before and after login. Functionality too slow..2 star at the moment until its run smoothly
Apps cant login. Wth is this!? Why do we need to get the securego from the apps when the apps can't even open?! Please fix! I have tons of bills to pay wih due dates!!!
Apps selalu error. So bila nak transfer, guna biz online, tapi tetap perlu approval dari apps ni yg langsung tak boleh buka. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bank islam should remain with web saja. No need app. Youre not ready to use app bila selalu error. Menyusahkan user.
Horrible.What is wrong with your apps? Now it is very slow to access my account.It keep on logging, until I give up.. You must keep up with other banks' app!
The worst bank app ever! Its always loading and takes too much time for me to use qr pay. I end up using other bank app which is more fast and efficient
Please upgrade your online banking system.There is always a problem when users want to log in and always use the excuse that your internet line is problematic but in fact it is not.Please take action as soon as possible because many users want to use it to pay all commitments.Thank you
After the new update version, I cant log in as the notifications keep on saying "unable to connect to the server" which is very hassle and time consuming to deal with. Very disappointed with the buggy apps and it doesnt seem helpful at all. Not sure if this happens to android users only or not.
The worst banking apps... Always loading for so long. Had to do everything in website since the apps is always having prob.
Too bad the apps so bad la. 2 days waiting to make transaction still cannot do. Using website also crashed. Please make an improvement asap.
I have tried many times to login still cannot login and the password is wrong eventhough i have entered the password correctly. Still having the same problem
The GO secure function is really frustrating. Always didn't work in crucial time. Please do something with your apps.
the application is really bad .. it's been two days since I've been trying to enter or login , I can't .. oh my god . It's hard to make a transaction..
The apps keeps crashing even i uninstall it. My id also cannot be detected. Why it keeps on loading????
Very very very poor online bank service. Have to try sooo many times before your transaction success using this apps. Please improve your poor service guys.
Using this apps for quite long and already updated the latest version,but i'm still don't see the improvement using this apps. Worst and too slow.
Very bad IB apps. Always shows error even though it has been updated to the latest. Please do something for the customers or else Bank Islam IB will always receive bad reviews.
What happen to this app, it took more time to open it, sometime it waste my time to wait just to transfer the money but in the end i could't.
Till still dont have any updated. I cant even open my app. Why your system is too bad? Please solve this problem! Why have update when is causing more trouble to user!
Why won't you take action eventho you have 1.2 ratings? Is user satisfaction not important? This app take too much times to load that makes it harder for any transaction especially after 'go secure' features. If you made an app that is this slow you should just use TAC number. Don't bother request for a rating if your company don't take action at all.
This app is really slow, maybe because of the server. Really need to upgrade the responds time for the sistem.
why need to relaunch the app for confirmation in online transaction, seriously then it stuck just loading forever. please fix asap ! edit : if i can give 0 star i will give it, have been use for a long time and theres no imrprovement in this app, what are you doing? cant this app be like other bangking app?
I cannot open the app after so many tries. This makes it harder to do a transfer. Please resolve the problem faster. Thank you.
Not happy with the apps efficiency. Loading, loading, loading until the time ended. Please improve your efficiency. So upset
cannot open the app after the update. Should fix this as it keep on loading for a long time.It still cannot open up to 3 days until now.
Worst bank app. Slow and always not responsive. Please, I BEG of you, please, make development for this app. Make it function as good as other bank apps.
Very disappointed with the apps. Take very long time to login and even cant doo fpx transaction. This app should make life easier with cashless payment nowadays.
Bank islam banking app is the slowest and the worst . Server always doesnt work. Imagine trying to pay using the app and u just stare at the loading white page for 30 minutes
Worst app ever, unable to log in around pay day week 25th until end of month for every month. Really difficult to make any online transaction during this period.
PLEASE HIRE BETTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPER. CUSTOMER CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE. SLOW SLOW SLOW, MAINTENANCE ALL THE WAY. SOMETIMES FUNCTION CAN'T BE USED. REBOOT THIS APP PLEASE.
Loading screen took so long and keep getting error message . Sometime biometric also cannot use .
Bad experience.. alway lag and have lots of problem especially on QR Code and scanning.. why even develop this app if you have no intention to maintain it?
After I put id, password, ic, I waited for a long time to get IAC number but it didn't send it to my mobile number! It's so annoying app!
Always need updated. Every transaction need approval by secure site (this case, by Bank Islam Go)..but pending and buffer too much. Not user friendly...
This app is getting worsen day by day, super slow and laggy and not advanced like other banks apps. Please improve your apps service.
Please la Bank Islam..do something about your GO apps..you want to force people using it, so please make it better!!!!!! If people want to use it but it keeps loading FOREVER!!! And often cant be use becouse YOU EXPERIENCE HIGH AMOUNT OF USER?? JUST SHUT DOWN THE APPS IF YOU DONT HAVE MONEY TO INVEST FOR IT AND MAKE IT BETTER. JUST STICK TO THE WEBSITE. NOW YOU MAKE IT HARD FOR YOUR CUSTOMER TO DO ANY TRANSACTION!! THAT JUST SO STUPID. PLEASE DO SOME CHANGE!!
Why always loading, take to long loading, sign out suddenly, need to uninstall and install back and came out with box that stated i need to performed transaction to TH, DUIT NOW AND OTHERS AFTER 12 HOURS.
Cannot scan qr from gallery..i already have latest version on my one plus 11
This app keep loading everytime we try to use it. It really annoying since every online transaction need to be verified by this app.
This apps stop working since 1week right when we need most! It keeps showing SERVER ERROR no matter I use WiFi or mobile data! Before that, this apps was not "internet friendly" bcoz it only needs high speed mobile data instead of basic data. However,even I used WiFi still not working and only 1@2 times,I can use after waiting more than 10mins loading!! And now, completely not working! I wish I can give zero star to this apps.
The apps is getting worse day by day. Been waiting for more than 10 mins just to get in...and sometimes didn't even get to log in.
too slow and laggy. sometimes need to wait for a long time to login. when to approve transaction even took a long time. please improve tremendously your app bank islam.
Why i cannot check my Tabung Haji account? The apps already update latest version 10. Please assist
Please la... So slow when open the apps, for 30+ min only "pusing-pusing". And please consider to bring back TAC since you apps can't even open to authorize my purchase
The apps is definitely less convenient than the website. But, nothing out of expectation. Because depending on the data you use the loading time of the apps may be slower or faster. Sometimes cannot use it because it was under maintenance but definitely not because of the apps itself if unable to use it. It also depends on your phone specs and storage. 😉
Dear developer, This app always stuck on login. When log in to app, I cannot log in to other browser. I want transfer my money to pay for the thing i buy. Fix this god dam stupit mf apps lah weh. Learn from MAE, CIMB Click and others.. Developer lena ka..
Forced to stay hungry the whole day without money because app is down & online banking down, and contactless card transaction cannot be used. I really hate this bank.
Your app is poorly optimised and not efficient to be used. Apps takes more than a minute to open up. It takes extra minutes just to do a simple transaction. Sometimes, it logout without my consent (While using the app). Please improve and see how other competitors have better mobile apps experience. 🙄 I m complaining because I was forced to use this bank because of my scholar and I don't like the experience so far.
Loading too long, access denied, then say i had logged in, cant even open in web, clear data and force stop then working, this apps clearly is broken.
Stuck at login page and never got through. Been having the problem for the last 2 months. After the new update, it gets worse. Now, could never use the app, have to use the browser version. In process of transferring all my funds into another bank, because their app dont give me this kind of problem. Thanks.
why this apps can't screenshot.. I can't give any proof too seller when i buy some thing when transfer the money. and this app always hank, then must uninstall n reinstall again n again..
I hardly login to this apps nowadays..It keeps loading,showing the circling icon everytime when ever I try to open it. Delete and reinstall many times,but the problem still the same..If this keep happens, I wont be able to use my Bimb online services since it is required to be approved from this apps, and it is so troublesome.
Worst banking apps. Keep loading although internet line is good. Unable to access the app for online transactions. Please improve
It's fine when it works, but right now it doesn't work more often than it does. Which is a problem since BIMB is now forcing their clients to use this app for transaction approvals. When you want to do that, then the app needs to be reliable, which this app is obviously not. It's taken me several tries and I still can't transfer my money.
unresponsive. very slow. give you good hard headache .
Please fix... keep getting error exceeded daily limit when making transaction. Need to switch using browser instead, such a hassle...
We were forced to use this app for our online transactions. But this app caused alot of problem. Server error. Cant connect to the server. Etc. Please Bank Islam don't so unprofessional. Dont cause your customers alot problems. Must I keep on unistalling and then reinstalling again to use your app? People complained but its look as if there is still no improvement. The customers still have had difficulties to use this app. So frustrated
I hv tried mny times to pay my bills last few days but never can log in go apps. U shud provide alternative. So disappointing.
Having problem to access my acc. The app kept loading and giving notification to use web. But when i tried login through web, it says i am already logged in due to the app despite the app already been closed. Tried to go back to the app, i got access denied! Been in constant loop going back and forth. This is very frustrating! The app got worst upon update.
Please improve service quality.. cannot be relied upon much needed.. it suck... The worse apps ever.. Do you guys don't have the person that can handle this ke . Shame lah .. Bank lain ada apps, bank hang pun nak buat apps .. buat lah betul betul.. buat kerja dengan kaki ke?
New update problem. This app stuck at asking me to accept / reject payment. But I did not do any payment. Please repair the problem.
Worst experience ever. Loading takes forever. Simple assignment cannot be done. Plan your schedule weeks ahead or just accept that nothing can be done through this app
Using this apps for quite long and already updated the latest version,but i'm still don't see the improvement using this apps. Worst and too slow.
It's very, way too annoying! Don't bother making an app if you don't intend for it to work! It's been a year or more since I have this app and it keeps crashing all the time. Can count with my finger how many times it work during a year! Please fix this or just delete this app from the playstore, u r making its hard since want to pay shoppee also got through this piece of app!
Can't even open smh.. Alr update, now can open but cannot log in..
Worst working apps. That's I can conclude about this apps..unable to connect to server, traffic bla bla bla. So frustrated.
Apps cant login. Wth is this!? Why do we need to get the securego from the apps when the apps can't even open?! Please fix! I have tons of bills to pay wih due dates!!!
Whoever in charge with developing this app should resign, not competent at all, most of the time not working
I have tried many times to login still cannot login and the password is wrong eventhough i have entered the password correctly. Still having the same problem
This app has been the lousiest since from the beginning. I hope the team will rectify the issue. Everytime error!
the most retarded app on planet, how could this app still exists at this moment. even a snail would be faster than this app, and whose idea was it to confirm the online purchase through this stupid app and thought it would be a great idea when it is slow as hell ?
Its sincerely getting worse!! Its keep loading without getting anywhere. Please fix this asap.. Ppl use it everyday.. If we just open it for it to be loading, then what the point???
Poor app. Not go for user friendly. Not easy to access. Unable to connect the server 😞😞😞
Not happy with the apps efficiency. Loading, loading, loading until the time ended. Please improve your efficiency. So upset
Please fire all of your swqa and dev team and management , lots of bugs in this app slow loading time, lots of items in app dissappearing reappearing randomly
Bank Islam Go is testing my patience. Banyak kena istighfar, banyak kena ingat kepada Allah because when you need to open the app, you can't because of high volume or because they're experiencing technical issues. Fix the app, Bank Islam, once and for good.
As of now (6/11/23 11.51pm) the app stays on loading page. Tried with different type of internet connection but it's still loading. Didn't have any issues through bimb webpage. Only the app. Already tried to restart the phone and open the app again though. P. S: after reading all the recent reviews, makes me wonder, does the latest version of the app is still very bad?
Fixed the rooted device issue on my last review. It gets the job done, but not in optimal way. I'd rather browsing through website compared to this. Loading each page was slow, even website version load faster. Whenever I wanted to do transfer be it IBG or Instant Transfer, I have to reinput my password again. I cannot use fingerprint authentication, as it was only for first app login. Another hassle for me.
Trash app. Can't even load the login page
I cannot open the app after so many tries. This makes it harder to do a transfer. Please resolve the problem faster. Thank you.
Transaction error error error error error non stop. Seriously noob, super useless especially TAC, making functional apps and services super trash. Just fired whoever team that development this apps.
The worst worst worst worst bank apps ever!!!!!! Take forever to load even though the wifi signal is good.. The web server is better than this stupid apps!!! But the web server is not that good also!!!!
I hardly login to this apps nowadays..It keeps loading,showing the circling icon everytime when ever I try to open it. Delete and reinstall many times,but the problem still the same..If this keep happens, I wont be able to use my Bimb online services since it is required to be approved from this apps, and it is so troublesome.
The worst banking app in Malaysia I've used. Everything loads up very poorly. You want to pay some stuff at the store using qr? Well, you'd die of old age first. Even the Bank Islam website sucks. People that uses this intentionally are masochists.
Supposed to be, an app make things easier. But this apps make things harder. Everytime I downloaded it, I need to key in the data like I'm a totally new user. Although I re-install it on the same device. Worst experience is today. When it magically TOTALLY log out. And when I try to login, it told me to key in data like I'm a new user. Need to re-setup qr pay. Need to key in IC number. The same app that has been running quite a few times before this on the same device. Deserve 0 star I think.
After the new update version, I cant log in as the notifications keep on saying "unable to connect to the server" which is very hassle and time consuming to deal with. Very disappointed with the buggy apps and it doesnt seem helpful at all. Not sure if this happens to android users only or not.
Very very very poor online bank service. Have to try sooo many times before your transaction success using this apps. Please improve your poor service guys.
Apps got lots of prob during startup. Reinstall and its gna deauthorize ir registered phone when all u want is to use back. Trash quality.
Bad interface and the worst of all, the line and the online services of the app is barely bearable at most. 0 star.
The apps took time for every process even log in also take too long . Very dissapointed . Sometime its very hard to make money transfer 👎
What happen to this app, it took more time to open it, sometime it waste my time to wait just to transfer the money but in the end i could't.
Fix the bugs and improve the server.
Been using the apps but lately the apps become suck. Super snail and giving a fuss to the customers. Please do something fast or ur going to loose a lot of customers
Apps selalu error. So bila nak transfer, guna biz online, tapi tetap perlu approval dari apps ni yg langsung tak boleh buka. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bank islam should remain with web saja. No need app. Youre not ready to use app bila selalu error. Menyusahkan user.
Very disappointed with the apps. Take very long time to login and even cant doo fpx transaction. This app should make life easier with cashless payment nowadays.
The Go app sooo slow n not responsive in good time. Its take too long for app to activate..its not help for urgent matter when to used it.
I can't open up the apps .. how i'm gonna make transaction? 😭 i already update to the latest One
When we r already at the cashier and the apps dont even work. There and then we tried to uninstal n reinstal.. but sometimes it wont work also after reinstall 🥲
Slow , Cannot do any transfactions. Then its better after the comments
unresponsive. very slow. give you good hard headache .
Till still dont have any updated. I cant even open my app. Why your system is too bad? Please solve this problem! Why have update when is causing more trouble to user!
It is definitely the slowest bank application in Malaysia. I have Maybank, Standard Chartered, Public Bank, UOB, Alliance, OCBC application in my phone. Bank Islam easily the winner in this category. Keep up the good work although I highly doubt that any other bank will be able to defeat you in term of buggy and laggy.
Worst bank app. Slow and always not responsive. Please, I BEG of you, please, make development for this app. Make it function as good as other bank apps.
Please upgrade your online banking system.There is always a problem when users want to log in and always use the excuse that your internet line is problematic but in fact it is not.Please take action as soon as possible because many users want to use it to pay all commitments.Thank you
cannot open the app after the update. Should fix this as it keep on loading for a long time.It still cannot open up to 3 days until now.
So slow to open this app, hopefully this problem will be solve in tge future.
Frequently lags. Loading to log in page very slow. Overall not very secure.
App Server always shows a slow as a snail app's navigation. Kindly check the server in case of hacker intrusion.
Very bad apps. The loading time is so long & it's really not convenient to use it compared to website. If you want to develop an apps make sure it is user friendly and very dissatisfied with this apps. Every transaction is very difficult and make your worry whether it is already successful to be transfer or not. Please make a change. Thank you.
I cannot open the app since I downloaded the new version. It kept showing the Unable to Connect to Server box everytime I open the app. I have been using it for 2 years and it got its up and down, but this time is the worst. And since everything needed to be aunthenticate using the Go app, found it very inconvenient and a huge hassle. Please do something about it. Thank you.
This app is extremely terrible, shame on the developers for not fixing it. Might as well use other alternatives than this slowpoke.
The login part kinda slow while waiting for loading. Sometimes, it freezes and crashed.
Always need updated. Every transaction need approval by secure site (this case, by Bank Islam Go)..but pending and buffer too much. Not user friendly...
Slow, lag and not user friendly
Very bad IB apps. Always shows error even though it has been updated to the latest. Please do something for the customers or else Bank Islam IB will always receive bad reviews.
Slow and laggy..almost every time cant sign in..need to relaunch the app several times.. tonight issue "cant connect to server".
After I put id, password, ic, I waited for a long time to get IAC number but it didn't send it to my mobile number! It's so annoying app!
"unable to connect to server" this problem has occurred few months now. very troublesome. edit : after reinstall this app, I finally can use it as before. BUT, the loading screen before entering the password took FOREVER 😢 if any of you having the same issue, and you are reading this, please clear the app's cache. it makes the app smoother
Loading slow, cant do transaction without it. So much for security when u cant even do a simple transaction
Love this apps. Easy and convenience to access. Go Bank Islam dah BETTER. Alhamdulillah.
PLEASE HIRE BETTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPER. CUSTOMER CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE. SLOW SLOW SLOW, MAINTENANCE ALL THE WAY. SOMETIMES FUNCTION CAN'T BE USED. REBOOT THIS APP PLEASE.
The apps is getting worse day by day. Been waiting for more than 10 mins just to get in...and sometimes didn't even get to log in.
This app is getting worsen day by day, super slow and laggy and not advanced like other banks apps. Please improve your apps service.
Your rating now 1.3..only 1 star..probably ending with no star if playstore allow us... each time update your apps keep freezing... stuck at loading page..do something.. look at your competitor..maybank..cimb...all good
Previous version is better..i cannot see my balance in TH after the update
Bad experience.. alway lag and have lots of problem especially on QR Code and scanning.. why even develop this app if you have no intention to maintain it?
to slow connection..fail..upset...more complicated
This app is really slow, maybe because of the server. Really need to upgrade the responds time for the sistem.
It's fine when it works, but right now it doesn't work more often than it does. Which is a problem since BIMB is now forcing their clients to use this app for transaction approvals. When you want to do that, then the app needs to be reliable, which this app is obviously not. It's taken me several tries and I still can't transfer my money.
Please la... So slow when open the apps, for 30+ min only "pusing-pusing". And please consider to bring back TAC since you apps can't even open to authorize my purchase
The GO secure function is really frustrating. Always didn't work in crucial time. Please do something with your apps.
New update problem. This app stuck at asking me to accept / reject payment. But I did not do any payment. Please repair the problem.
Worst app ever, unable to log in around pay day week 25th until end of month for every month. Really difficult to make any online transaction during this period.
Cannot scan qr from gallery..i already have latest version on my one plus 11
Worst ever, cannot check available balance at all. Any banking payment also lag and too slow. What happen????
da update.. tapi apa yg lambat sgt nk bukaknya..yg lama lagi better than new veraion.. take so long to. open.. disappointed betul dgn isu apps bank islam ni
This app keep loading everytime we try to use it. It really annoying since every online transaction need to be verified by this app.
Loading too long, access denied, then say i had logged in, cant even open in web, clear data and force stop then working, this apps clearly is broken.
Update in April 2023 It's becoming worse. I can't even open the app even after reinstalling it after clear history, cache and reset phone. Recent update is causing problems to open the app. I am unable to use it completely. It take ages to open as well as use the GO verification. I uninstalled, clear cache multiple times with wifi and data connection without any success. I am sure the problem comes from the app itself.
This is most worst bank app in Malaysia. I wonder why Uitm compulsory for student to use Bank Islam as main student bank account?. App very slow, always show loading bubble, I'm unable to log in to app. Bank Islam you are multimillion company, you are supposedly able to upgrade and fix app without problem. New update: I'm done!!!. Time to close Bank Islam account or let's account became dormant. I'm suggest user closed account and change to Maybank MAE and Cimb Octo or transfer to TNG E-wallet.
Bank islam banking app is the slowest and the worst . Server always doesnt work. Imagine trying to pay using the app and u just stare at the loading white page for 30 minutes
I hv tried mny times to pay my bills last few days but never can log in go apps. U shud provide alternative. So disappointing.
Unable to do fund transfer. Keep getting error code. The basic function of transferring money is not properly develop.
Why i cannot check my Tabung Haji account? The apps already update latest version 10. Please assist
I've updated this app and I've lost RM13 once I logged in. Have been checked the transaction history and didn't know where it goes. I still remember the balance in my account. Plus, I just went to ATM a week ago. The amount is still fresh in my head. Got the receipt too. I'm truly disappointed and can no longer trust it. What if losing large amount of money after this? It's scary. I guess I should uninstall this app :( it's no longer secure for me
Why always loading, take to long loading, sign out suddenly, need to uninstall and install back and came out with box that stated i need to performed transaction to TH, DUIT NOW AND OTHERS AFTER 12 HOURS.
I keep on getting 'unable to connect to server' issues and sometimes had to reinstall the apps due to crash and all. Is there any explanation to this? Issues like this have made it so difficult for me to make a transaction especially on important one. So, I'm truly disappointed. I hope you all can fix this. It hindred people's business and matter. Also, why does the app won't allow screenshot? Sometimes, I forgot to share my receipt and try to find back my transaction record but can't screenshot
Please fix... keep getting error exceeded daily limit when making transaction. Need to switch using browser instead, such a hassle...
The apps keeps crashing even i uninstall it. My id also cannot be detected. Why it keeps on loading????
Very disturbing.. every transactions becomes hard due to error of system. It takes time and not efficient at àll. Please update ur service at it is very slow and not working. The service is still not working despite having reinstalled a few times. Saying that I haven't registered though just send me verification of successful register.!!???
Worst banking apps. Keep loading although internet line is good. Unable to access the app for online transactions. Please improve
After the update, the app keep crashing and pop up said "server error, unable to connect to server". This has been going for weeks and I can't use duitnow for most of my purchases and transfer which is frustrating. Why the update bring down the app instead of "fixing the bug" like the update state. I'm mortified and scared at the thought my account can be easily hacked while the app crashing.
Much more worst. I cannot login to my acc and usually if i want to login, it always pop out 'high volume of traffic.' what-
why need to relaunch the app for confirmation in online transaction, seriously then it stuck just loading forever. please fix asap ! edit : if i can give 0 star i will give it, have been use for a long time and theres no imrprovement in this app, what are you doing? cant this app be like other bangking app?
Forced to stay hungry the whole day without money because app is down & online banking down, and contactless card transaction cannot be used. I really hate this bank.
Looking forward for better online service. This apps too slow for loading and frequent error issue on server.
too slow and laggy. sometimes need to wait for a long time to login. when to approve transaction even took a long time. please improve tremendously your app bank islam.
Every time update new version. Making it more complicated in all ways. Fingerprint can't access, face recognition take times, need 2 times key in password, auto log out, buffering at all the time until i sleep and wake up on the next day and still buffering. Neither use android or ios, the experience of using is still the same, getting worse.
The worst banking apps... Always loading for so long. Had to do everything in website since the apps is always having prob.
App paling useless. Susah nk access, loading then lastly tak boleh nk buka pun.
Too slow to load in login page. I want to use urgently QR Pay yesterday.
i think no star for this application. very bad. so stress use this. take so long time to open. difficult to transfer/payment. waste time!!
Slow and this app should be optional, not users need to download your app just to use your services. Make it optional.
Worse bank app ever. Can't event log in. Take so much time to load around 5-10 minutes. Pls fix. I'm a student so it's hard for me to pay some stuff
App keeps getting crash and error for login. Please please fix this. Even nak bukak online punya kt website pun slow sangat ya. Do something to fix this asap.
Ever since the Error 500 appeared, the app collapsed and unable to be open. Tried deleting cache, data, force stop it but nothing works. I wanted to do simple transactions using DuitNow but I can't. Uninstalling and reinstalling is a lot of work because you have to setup your account back.
Why remove the option to make transactions using the website? Seems like another unnecessary application that you must download for basic banking service. At least give us a choice!
It has been almost a week i cant access to my account. Last week was due to huge traffic. Today, unable to connect to server.
Please fix this app. It is annoying when you need to transfer money urgently but this app takes tooooooo longgggg loading. Very bad app.
Really slow. I can't stress this enough. My patience is running even thinner every time I need to use this app. Why we need to authorise from the app when the app is this slow? I looked at your replies to the other users and they're just the same things being said over and over again. It really shows that you don't care about us. I already cleared the cache and uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but still can't even log in. I've done the best that I can, so why can't you guys do the same?
Super slow, super clunky, super inefficient
Bad..Cannot even open the app..many times say 'Currently under maintenance'. Hard to do transactions. Please fix the issue.
I cant open this apps after update!!!previous better than this!!! Fix it!!!
Unable to install ..only able to open using playstore then problem to do transfer ..I think this is worst app ever then other bank ...please do something
Very slow app, it take a long time just to open the app and most of the time i cannot access the app at all.
Deserves no star. The worst app for a bank. Loading too long. Always lag and crash. Serioulsly this app needs improvements
Where is the menu to view transaction signing? Adding or deleting favorite accounts has become difficult! If you click on the Transaction Signing notification bar while using the apps, it won't redirect to the correct page to approve the transaction. And there is no way to view the current Transaction Signing! Inbox messages cannot be clicked too! Disappointing! This apps is only good to view the current balance, that's all!
Among the dumbest feature with this apps is they didnt let me screen shot due to privacy policy THIS JUST REALLY EXTREMELY BOTHERING ME, I CANT SHARE MY PAYMENT PROOF BECAUSE I FORGOT TO SHARE THE PDF FILE AFTER I PAID MY SELLER AND I PROCEED TO HOME SCREEN END UP CANT TAKE SCREENSHOT ANYWHERE WITHIN THE APPS? WHY CIMB APPS DIDNT DO THIS? SO WHY WOULD YOU?
Can't login since yesterday. Already updated the app. 🤬
why this apps can't screenshot.. I can't give any proof too seller when i buy some thing when transfer the money. and this app always hank, then must uninstall n reinstall again n again..
No star for a bad apps. Im 1st time want to register. Cannot open at all and just appeared server error!!
Hello, I can't open my apps to check my account. It just said server error. Even the website can't be open. Please fix it.
I can't log-in to the app using my new phone. I have been installing and uninstalling the app for many time but the problem keep on going. Whenever I try to log-in, the app suddenly close. Like when i fill up my bank id and it started loading then the app close and it went back to my phone homepage. I tried many time and I nearly reach to the final step, but it still suddenly close. Please solve this problem quickly cause it is inconvenience to make a transactions thru the website. Thank you.
Always load for a very long time especially when I'm trying to make transaction causing the transaction to be cancelled.
one of the worse performing online banking app with multiple downtimes and bugs
Worst. Always encountered Server Error Unable to connect to the server. What should I do then???
After i updated, i cnnot log into the app anymore!
Makin Update, Makin teruk. Kena clear data storage setiap kali nak launch app ni...
Loading screen took so long and keep getting error message . Sometime biometric also cannot use .
A very unreliable piece of technology. Takes forever to go to login page, and sometimes even fail. I have to clear cache and storage then reopen to see the login page. To transfer money, the bank require the GO authorization but when you cannot even open the app and login this will make it useless. I suggest to first remove the need for GO authorization and stick to 6 digit codes until you guys fix the issues for your app. 1 star review overall is not a very good look for the brand. Best of luck
Cant open the app, it stuck on loading screen
Dear developer, This app always stuck on login. When log in to app, I cannot log in to other browser. I want transfer my money to pay for the thing i buy. Fix this god dam stupit mf apps lah weh. Learn from MAE, CIMB Click and others.. Developer lena ka..
Fix this app at least please. Cannot take screenshot for proof of payment. And loading , took forever. Apps is not so friendly user.
Need to approve transaction in app, app forever loading. At least give option for sms code for fak sake. Might actually change bank just because of this app
Please fixed this apps, it was not stable sometimes I can login using fingerprint sometime its cannot..if I can put 1/2 star ..that is your rating I can give to your app
Been using this app for years and it was smooth. But after recent update, it just went from good to worst! Whenever i tried to login, keep on pop-up 'unable to reach server'. Super annoying! Then i uninstall and re-install, looks fine but when i keyin my ic number, it detect as error. U guys please fix it asap.
By far the worst banking app. Always auto logged out due to the server issue. And to login will require few attempts which is ridiculous. The UI is bery basic and sometimes a bit confusing for example hard to notice which one is required field. Why don't you just suggest to re-install the app? BIMB User. Person_A: can just transfer me the money. Me: Great! Lemme uninstall and install this wonderful banking app.
problem app,i cannot open the apps for swveral times
Such a nuisance/ problematic/ inconvenient apps..need to do transaction asap, but not able to open apps or even online banking..what a turndown..improve la bank islam
I don't know what's wrong with Bank Islam app anymore. Previous version is more stable, easy and user-friendly. And now? Double menyusahkan users.
0.5 star if i can put here. The worst apps for banking. I cant even open the apps properly to accept the transaction. Just keep the tac style laa, dont copy other banking apps. Haiyaaa!
The worst online banking apps Ive used. It took forever just to load. Then another forever to load any payment methods.
Better than Road Runner . Just imigine.
The function of this apps make so difficult to transfer my money to make payment for my car n my grab n all my apps.. Why this apps took so long to loading. 2 days waiting n still loading.. Do something bnk islam why so weak
Shouldn't have given a star. First of all this is inconvenient at all. The website is much more better. I'm trying to do a single transaction over days but still can't. Go to 'Go secure' put in the digits still NOTHING. The needs to log in everytime and then the apps log out suddenly when making transaction so irritating. Plus the 'not valid' when literally just a second after log in. A single transaction but this much troubles is so frustrating. It's making me lost temper everytime.
Very bad. App is not working. Even after update. Any other way to do online transfer now?
I have been using the app for more than a year (maybe) and there have been massive improvements, kudos to the developers 👍🏻 I'm looking forward to future improvements especially in these 3 aspects - a more friendlier GUI (not too robot-ish please), a more complete/comprehensive transfer experience and frequent updates to fix the bugs. Additionally I have a question, the ability to add fav transfers is actually also not available on other banking apps, is it for security reasons?
I want to transfer money urgently but they asked to download the go bank apps. The darn app cannot even be accessed. Failed to connect to server. Wth
This is the worst app ever. I can't even tap go secure how do I want to transfer for online banking, this is so annoying
Worst app, always loading and high volume traffic. Need approvement and be like a maybank app easier to people. Go to online banking site also same.
The app suddenly cannot open , it say server error.. Already tried to uninstall and install back but still same. Why ahhh ayoooooooooo
System always down .. very hard to make online transaction . if this have ZERO star , i will rate this . Its been years !
Almost there with BSN with the most inefficient banking service in Malaysia. Useless apps / online platform every end of the month
Cant even access the apps..transfer through website but it to go to the apps to be able to transfer..but everytime i want to access cant even enter the apps..the apps always problem..
Pleaseeeeee update the app to be faster.I am really annoyed using this app.the login session itself took about more than one minute.please change your technical team or hire the better new team ASAP!
Apps are so slow and annoying. I keep getting access denied. Please improve it.
This app does not deserve even one star. Keep loading until forever cannot be used, always in high traffic issue.
not a good bank app. Loading for very long time. Got problem when to buy stuff on shopee & when i want to topup my internet. I can't take it anymore
Wouldn't even give this app a single star if I could. You forced us to use this app for such security reason but didn't even manage to even come with a good apps. Please do some quick improvements
The previous version is better. The current app is so slow and annoying. Please fix this ASAP!
The server always got error, please fix it! I can't even log in to my account because of that!
The apps is definitely less convenient than the website. But, nothing out of expectation. Because depending on the data you use the loading time of the apps may be slower or faster. Sometimes cannot use it because it was under maintenance but definitely not because of the apps itself if unable to use it. It also depends on your phone specs and storage. 😉
Getting worst day by day.Make it verify on the app after using the web for transaction.But the app was not working properly and immidiate urgent transaction all getting delay.
CAN'T USE AT ALL. LOADING FOR A LONG TIME THEN ERROR. TRIED UNINSTALL THEN REINSTALL BUT SAME RESULT. ITS BEEN ALMOST A WEEK. PLEASE FIX IT IMMEDIATELY. THANK YOU. IM A LONG-TIME USER
This app make me spoil to do on9 transaction still cannot use and so bad to me,ples take action to solve this problem ASAP to give and make excellent app for easy to use tq
Now can't even open app. Keeps saying high volume of traffic and tell us to try again later. EPIC FAIL
Slow n loading. Apa punya app laaaa. Buatla sesuatu.
Please improve service quality.. cannot be relied upon much needed.. it suck... The worse apps ever.. Do you guys don't have the person that can handle this ke . Shame lah .. Bank lain ada apps, bank hang pun nak buat apps .. buat lah betul betul.. buat kerja dengan kaki ke?
Please do fix your app. I been try to open the app to pay via QR. Its been 2 hours trying to open it. Still fail to do so. Soo emberassing when want to buy something and pay using QR.
We were forced to use this app for our online transactions. But this app caused alot of problem. Server error. Cant connect to the server. Etc. Please Bank Islam don't so unprofessional. Dont cause your customers alot problems. Must I keep on unistalling and then reinstalling again to use your app? People complained but its look as if there is still no improvement. The customers still have had difficulties to use this app. So frustrated
This bank app is by far the worst. It's very slow to load, at least 2 mins at the loading screen. I am not exaggerating! Crashes all the time. Verification details sometimes doesn't appear. Seriously, how does a relatively big bank have such an app? I sincerely hope a major improvement is done soon!
Why won't you take action eventho you have 1.2 ratings? Is user satisfaction not important? This app take too much times to load that makes it harder for any transaction especially after 'go secure' features. If you made an app that is this slow you should just use TAC number. Don't bother request for a rating if your company don't take action at all.
VERY BAD experience. The switching between the acc is so not user-friendly. And now I have a problem to access my company acc because of "invalid credential". I need an urgent transfer and now THIS. If you want to make every transfer more secure by doing this, please make sure the app is good-enough. I hope to see the improvements. Pleasseee...
I cannot access this app as the app unable to connect with the server. I hope this thing can be settle asap.
Terrible! Worst online banking I've ever had. Kasi tutup sajalah app!
The app is soo buggy. It just keep on loading after opening the app. If it didn't stuck loading, it will take a few minutes for it to finish loading and show the login screen. What's the point of having an app if it much more of a hassle to use. By far the most horrible banking app i ever used.
Please improve your user experience. App cannot open and cannot approve any transaction. What is the point of having the app if cannot be open
many times unable to load and log in . bank islam please upgrade your services apps
Everytime nak guna, had to wait flipping long time, the berudu keep spinning infinitely. Please improve BIMB
Not recommended tbh. After the recent update, it logged me off and I had to re-register into the app and it crashed after inputting the security code. Many. Times. There's also instances where it kept having issues even before this. And here I thought the octopus app is bad, but this is next level of terrible.
Dah uninstall, lepas tu install balik but still tak boleh bukak pun apps. Bad services.
Sehari semalam dah cuba log in. Asyik loading jaaaaaaa. I dont know when will this apps function well. Always unable to log in. Worst bank apps ever.
very bad experience. after a year uninstalled this app, still no improvement. teruk sangat, please improve lah!!!!!!
The worst app ever..i got the same issue with others..this app became very bad, take time to log in and slow than before..
It's been a week now and the app can't be opened at all. I can't even log in the system. Please fix this issue ASAP
What wrong with your apps recently? After updating the system suddenly i cannot open it at all?!?! Fix it faster please. This issue have not being fixed even after more than 1 week. Dissapointing. It have been very convenient to use it past few years but not anymore. I can't even open it now!
An annoying incompetent app. I can't even get to the log in page, it just keeps on uselessly loading for eternity. The most infuriating thing is that every transaction needs GO authorization, so I'm just here unable to pay my student debt for months. If you're going to make it so important at least make it usable at the very least. FIX IT.
To much buffering. Server need to be upgrade to ensure system running smooth. Nak transfer duit pun payah. Kalau server down notify la customer. Bukan duduk diam je. Ni every hour nak try login utk access tp error sama je. Takkan notify pun ego juga.
Terrible. It used to be the most handy app for transactions. Now i can't even get through the login page. What happened BIMB?? Apps are supposed to make online banking easier but this is the other way around. It has been going on for months now eversince the most recent update. Would very much appreciate if your team can find the problem and fix it asap!
Always have bug n need to be updated.so annoying
Why so much problem lately with Bank Islam apps? Can't even authorize payment and error pops APZ_TSN_0001 transaction is expired (when it is not)
Bad and terrible. The most annoying baking app ever. U don't understand how it can be worser than it was already is. The loading takes far too long and then suddenly cannot login anymore. The go secure is not available to approve anything, can't even click and always error.
Can i know how long you are making this app to loading.. I'm waiting for a long time to open this application.. Please make it faster to open or don't have any loading app
Worse experience of all banking app. Please make good old times TAC than using fully method GO app. I can't even launching the app
What is the purpose to force your customers to use unstable application service? It's very hard to open the application and how will it looks for us when we need to pay instant in front of a counter? Is this another type of promoting method for encourage your customers to change bank?
Takes forever to load the Ui, fingerprint login failed most of the time, lots of server errors and incomplete displayed infos. *Using a good phone w high speed data and more than decent urban speed, screen sensor works in every other app enabled fingerprint access. So, IT'S THE APP & SERVER. And....did the switch off on phone,clear cache, reset data, uninstall reinstall stuffs. So..Yeah.
Worse experience with new version apps. Bank islam take very long time to solve the apps problems. Very disappointed 😔
It's been two weeks since the latest update and the same problem hasnt been solved, 'unable to connect to server', unable to log in. The only solution that they can provide is 'please reinstall', 'please use the lastest version' as if we havent done it before. Very disappointing. Would rate a zero if I could.
very incredibly slow ive never seen an app this slow fix it even with good internet connection it keeps lagging and takes forever to load
I am okay with the Apps, it is easy to use and I have no issue of logging into the Apps. The only problem that I encountered is receiving the IAC. I have to request new IAC at least twice everytime when performing online transactions (it took me longer time to complete just a transfer). Please advise. Thanks.
App paling mudah nak pakai... Sometime problem.. Tp masih better than others
Worst banking apps. Changing transaction limit should not take too long to be effective. Lol
Not supposed to be any star. The worst app ever. Not user friendly, not worth having it. I can't even make any transaction via online or the app. If not 'no service' its either 'error' for whatever reason. Worst of all it say session exp. Like what the F!! I just open the thing like few seconds ago. Keep logout for no reason too. It was easier before if I need to pay immediately or for emergency now it take almost a whole day just to make 1 transaction.
Just to login need a lot time of waiting. How to make transaction with this kind of problem. Make thing more complicated
I thought making an app should ease the users, not make it more difficult. Its annoying that every time the app has an issue need to uninstall and reinstall back app or update it, and bimb doesn't send notification on updates of the app or app issue so its really hard to know what's the problem. The website page is much more easier to use compare to the app.
Apps paling slow antara online banking . Please upgrade. Penat nk tnggu loading
I have to give two stars only as for now the transactions that can only be use in the app confirmation to do any transactions online like buying from Shopee and it take a lot of time for user to be able to do that stuff then before that more faster which is using an old way which is receiving the TAC code. It also take a lot of attempts to make the transactions successfully completed. I hope Bank Islam can improve this con/problem as fast as it could. That all from me. Thank you.
Improved a lot but still can improve for better.
Why can't take the screenshot? I tried to take a few screenshots but still can't..
Worse, app loading very slow.. money transfer also late. Sometimes i pay double just because this app very slow
It was easy navigation & functioning really good before, but now just to log in I have to try 3-4 times, then after log in, to do transaction also it keeps on loading until the session expired. Is it safe anymore. Please do something, before I change my banks. Dont ask me to make a report again, just read this & do something quick. Bank should be reliable & secure!!
For the 4th time I'm writing this review until the dev team can fix the bug. So here goes, I got stucked at the loading screen even when I'm connected to the internet. After loading, it goes to the 'good afternoon' page, it was a blank page, no button or whatsoever, got stucked there. Uninstall the app and installed it again, same thing happened. I can conclude this app is non functinal and utterly useless. Step up your game and learn from MAE ;)
Stuck at login page and never got through. Been having the problem for the last 2 months. After the new update, it gets worse. Now, could never use the app, have to use the browser version. In process of transferring all my funds into another bank, because their app dont give me this kind of problem. Thanks.
You guys need to do something about this app. It keeps crashing, no matter how many times reinstall the app. This is one of the most important channel to do transactions, yet it happens to be so lagged, not responsive and keep popping error. Afraid that u r losing customers, sir.
After update the latest version the app doesn't open at all & not supporting. Once the app open, it automatically close it by itself. It's vry difficult to perform any transactions & need to use chrome or desktop. The problem has been continued for more than 3 weeks. Regretting for updating the latest version😒
the survey always have a problem, always be dragging my time, always crashing like everytime i wanna make a payment, what do you guys even doing? by just keep updating the app but the app are stil the same with the old problems? what a waste of time. All of the reviews from the users have been stating the same problem but nothing changed. Do your work properly by fixing the bug and so on. My connection doesn't have a problem but the app are just horrible. Do what you need to do. PLEASE FIX THIS
So far so good. Maybe take a look into the back button function, it's better to not directly logout, just instead go back to the previous screen. Same as most of users, the biometric login doesn't work. And when will the DuitNow will be integrate into the GO app? Much easier to transfer money if it is available.
Although to the internet connection is strong the apps remain weak as usual. It will take at least 15 minutes most of the time use the apps services. Sometimes to even open the apps it will take too much time. Hopefully, this can be resolved quickly as it will waste a lot of time especially for those who were in rush because of their jobs or important matter.
The app was superb but not anymore. The last update really messed this app up. It has been a week or more since it can be accessed. Now, it keeps telling server error every time the app is opened. I don't see any immediate fixed on this one ever since. Very disappointed. I'm giving one star for now.
The worst bank that I have used ever. 1. When open the bank app, it shows loading icon for 2-3 minutes before enter into the next page. 2. Many times when I do online transaction, Go secured does not respond or announce "transaction failed" etc... has always wasted my time & energy to try to uninstall & reinstall then re-login 3. Stupid main page that shows the account balance BIG & BOLD, which make has no sense of privacy at all.
This is the worst banking app I have ever used. Lately it has been almost useless. Takes ages to to work, not to mention the endless moments of frustration when it displays 'high traffic volume', among others. At shop checkout I often keep other customers waiting while waiting for the app to work, if at all . What a shame for a bank. With the all the bad reviews I don't see the problems solved. Please don't keep telling users to clear cache or what not...I am sure they do that all the time.
Update, it is getting worse, I cant access my account at all. When I logged in it just load then straight up logged me out. I cant access my account at all and the "Server Error" keep on popping up. This app should make it easier for me to transfer money etc but now, I have to use the website. This happens after I updated the app.
Since the start of my usage of GO, I realise the loading time has always been very slow. Frequently javing server error or simply an error to connect. Its like, almost all cashiers at my local stores would describe to me anyone who uses the white/red app is a bad choice and the yellow or Blue app, is the right choice. MasyaAllah how can this be persistent for almost half a year now. Im sure you all have your Tech team. If the interface has problems, whatabout the security, is it questionable too
App always hang and I need to always reset the ibanking because for some reason, they keep telling me I got the credentials wrong. Resetting password is also another issue and always in circles. End up with the issue not resolved. Overall disappointed with the app, the website is more or less the same as well. Only a matter of time for me to close my BIMB account.
App is very slow. Most of the time I can't even log into the app as it just keeps on loading for a very long time. Don't tell me to clear cache, clear storage, reinstall bla bla bla. I'VE TRIED AND IT JUST DOESN'T WORK. Very frustrating. This problem has been going on since last year. Seems to me like they didn't want to take initiative to fix the issue.
The apps become useless if you are in need-to-hurry situation. It takes so much time to load the first page before can use the service. A lot of time, its faster to open browser and go to the site compare to using the apps itself. Then, it defeats the purpose of having the apps in the first place.
Why is it that everytime on salary day, I can't open the app? I had to uninstall & install again. It just get annoying because I need to set up again from the start. The app itself is easy too use, so i wish this would be resolved quickly. Edit (3 May): The developer response to my email regarding my issue pretty quickly, even tho I email them late at night... So, kudos. Improve my rating. Still cannot actually give 5 star la cuz still not perfect.
Always problem when open...buffering until forever
The app is slow and always loading and failed to enter. Everytime i want to make transaction, i need to uninstall and reinstall the app. Can you do something about this? It's such a hassle to uninstall and reinstall every single time when i need to do transaction. Update based on reply by admin : I have never experience this problem with other bank app. I don't have to clear cache to enter any other bank app.
Since the new update, opening the apps is impossible. Always gets stuck at the log in page. Have uninstalled and installed so many times, but the issue of being stuck at log in page is still the same. It makes it difficult to use the GO app to make payments or transactions.
Garbage app, keep getting "Server Error, unable to connect". The website was working fine before and now you need the app to approve duitnow transfers. Why fix thing that was not broken? When you are able to actually access your account, navigation within the app is also sluggish and slow. It takes forever to just do a simple transfer. Seriously considering closing my bank islam account and migrate to a better service.
Why the app is so slow? When I opened the app, the loading animation will play like forever. Can't access the app at all. I have already cleared the cache, I have cleared the data, didn't work. I have uninstalled and installed the app again, worked but only the first time login. Next time I want to login this thing happened again. The app used to work properly now what happened? It has been like this since middle of last year. Were there no fix?
I can't log-in to the app using my phone. I have been installing an uninstalling the app for many time but the problem keep on going. I try to log-in the app suddenly close. I tried to many time and i nearly reach to the final step, but its suddenly close. Please solve the problem quickly. Thank you.
Been using this app over a year. While it has it's drawbacks over its competitors, GO is definitely an upgrade over the old system where you need to access your account from your browser. The app's responsiveness is a bit lacking but overall it achieved its basic functionality.
Very poor apps. Once installed, tried to sign in a few times. Each time it says server problem. Finally was able to sign in. But the balance shown is zero which is impossible coz the would definitely ask me to close the account. Tried again later. Same thing. Zero balance. So decided to uninstall. Please look at other banks app especially maybank. It's much more friendlier.
Please do something, it's not easy to log in, sometimes can, at some times cannot. Already done the clear cache step n using mobile network, reinstall a few times n it's still the same. It's very annoying as we need to use apps for higher amount transaction. Why bother update the apps when the previous version is much better??
Always unable to access the system due to server error or unable to connect to server. I have tried almost everything including switching from data to wifi, but still not working. The app is very inconvenient. Please do something about it.
UX is good enough but need some improvement. Eg, the fingerprint approval for duit now. After logged in to the system with finger print must have approval again but of on main menu no need. Wierd isn't it? Overall, the app was good but feels unpolished and inconsistent. Maybe can ask for more budget for app development next time. If development is on the way then can wait to try.
Cannot log in the apps since day 1 after set up. Install and uninstall few times also. Logging in always error "APZ_TSN_0003" came up. Tried both Mykad / IC number with and without dash "-" but still unable to log in. Tried using home secured wifi as well as phone own internet data but not successful - same error code number came up. Not sure how to rate this apps. However , using the same usename, same password for internet banking - works fine and able to perform all transaction needed.
Please fix your apps! I'm getting difficulties to view the accounts. If let say the network is unstable and the apps lost connection, User not able to logout. When I re-login again, looks like I need to wait for another 24 hours!!!! Open account with you wasting my time. Poor apps services, just like BSN.
I've been having issues logging in since 3weeks now, been reinstalling the apps many times but the same problems keep showed up "couldn't connect to the server" "high network trafficking, too many users" bla3. But even up until today, the app wont fix. It was working perfectly fine before the update, now it has become haywire & I can't do cashless transactions no more. Pls fix the app ASAP developer?!
Oh ya guys, about the "unable to connect to server" problem, i think you guys should uninstall the application, and then install again. I think it worked out for me. I'm not sure if it works for you, but can give it a try ☺️. I saw the notice on the website, i think it supposedly to work like that.
It's not really functional. The fingerprint doesn't work and the app keep getting frozed. I kept installed and reinstalled but still the same. Theres a time that it can be use and there's a time that can't. I have to use the old fashion way which is via web page key in manually to log in. Please take note and fix it as internet banking is very important nowadays.
I don't understand. It's so weird, where this time I updated the app. Later, when I logged in, there's noti pop up saying it needs a change in permission setting which I really don't understand what's that permission for. Previously, it mentioned about accessing my location, which I refused to. Then, my app didn't work.
Very very bad app, sorry Bank Islam but you shouldn't make an app if it's not giving convenience to the users. The problem is not even with the interface but the server itself - very long loading time, easily crashed, can't function properly, can't take high traffic, etc. Please fix it, you're losing users' trust!
This time I had to re install the apps. Once installed I am able to go in and used the apps. But after logging out and tried to re enter, I am unable to go in. It seems that the icon save on phone screen is not responding when I touched it. Sorry no screenshot. Already installed and uninstalled several time.
It's a good app but I hope the developer can link the internet banking history and mobile banking history and make it into one single history list. Plus, I cannot download the receipt of transaction I made. Even there is a download button, it's for all transaction. Not details. Just able to screenshot only.. So, whenever I need to do important/formal transaction I need to open internet banking instead of just use the app.
I can forgive if an app is slow, but this app is downright unusable. App takes forever(literally never ending time) to load and would sometimes crash mid transaction. Hopefully there will be a new version of this app that can go toe to toe with competitors.
It's really frustrating that lately it's taking so damn long to load the app.. at first i though it was a problem with my internet connection but all of my friends that are using this app also experience the same thing.. idk what's wrong with the system but please fix it.. it's hard to use cashless payment method if it's always taking so long to load like this..
Latest system makes my bill payments delay because I need to be logged out for some time before I can log in again in another application. Quite a hasle. If it is for safety reasons, I think your team need to figure out other way around. Not everyone have the leisure to make bills payment on separate occasions.
This app is a fail. Not just it takes too long to load every pages, its not even functioning well. I once make a interbank transfer and the status is pending! I tried again using website and it works fine. So i had to call the customer service to report about it and it took almost a week to get refund. Worst experience ever. I should've stick to using website.
Please upgrade or update your system. System lag and work very slowy even with high speed internet. Very difficult to make online transactions. Mine always has system error and i cannot log into my account. It has been continuing for few month already. Getting security code is also a problem as i was always getting late msg.
After reading several previous previews, I personally endured the same problem which is, unable to log in using the apps. Seems like no improvement to curb the problem. Another issue which I noticed is that using the internet banking method, the steps are confusing. Why can't you simplify ways and methods.
This apps stop working since 1week right when we need most! It keeps showing SERVER ERROR no matter I use WiFi or mobile data! Before that, this apps was not "internet friendly" bcoz it only needs high speed mobile data instead of basic data. However,even I used WiFi still not working and only 1@2 times,I can use after waiting more than 10mins loading!! And now, completely not working! I wish I can give zero star to this apps.
After updating the apps, I cannot log in to my account as the server keep saying unable to connect to the server which is very inconvenient. This is not the first time it happens but almost every time when update the apps. It's not ok as the apps should be more better to user after updating not making it worst. Really sad though.
Always unable to access into this apps with error msg appeared as "due to high traffic". I suppose the bank should be happy and expecting the high traffic as the mark of trust from the user. Please fix it.. to be honest, both apps and website version. I have headache with both today, and customer service always unreachable due to the high numbers of call.
Your app is poorly optimised and not efficient to be used. Apps takes more than a minute to open up. It takes extra minutes just to do a simple transaction. Sometimes, it logout without my consent (While using the app). Please improve and see how other competitors have better mobile apps experience. 🙄 I m complaining because I was forced to use this bank because of my scholar and I don't like the experience so far.
After recent update (date of update release 11/11/2022), the app can't be access at all and it been days, days that it shows "Server error" failure even though my data connection is stable and all. Repeating the step to try again doesn't matter because the same error window keep popping and restrict access into this app. Thankfully your website doesn't crash like this tho but still 🙁
"unable to connect to the server" this thing happen so many time. should repair it immediately or just throw this apps. how many times to clear cache as you said but things happen badly i still cannot login and the same message appear "unable to connect to server". trying to uninstall and reinstall but same problem occur. really dissappointed
The app is always unstable. It took too much time to load and sometimes it couldn't open at all. Please fix it. Things that were supposed to be done easily & quickly will turned out to be a complete disaster. I like to go cashless so I need the app to be available easily all the time
Thing is, I had great difficulty to establish whether this is a legit app or not. I only noticed the previous version was no longer functioning and found this Go app in the Play store. Checked in BIMB website and still no mention of this new app superseding the old one. My advise to BIMB is to be more professional when handling digital content. Make an official announcement in the website about any new digital app or way of handling.
Couldn't log in since about a week ago. Got 'unable to connect to server' error. Tried many times on different days. Same problem. Cleared cache, cleared data, same problem. Uninstalled, reinstalled fresh with the latest version, still couldn't log in. Please advise a solution ASAP as I see many other users facing the same problem. I am using Android.
I've been using this app for 2+ year or so, no problem that really concern me before beside some little bug, but after a several update last year this apps is useless, always loading at the start up screen, now i cannot use duitnow transfer, this happen to me when i'm at supermarket queing to pay my groceries but the apps won't load at all, now i have to go to atm machine to withdraw cash, please fix this problem fast!
Its very frustrating, the system always down, the apps always have problem to scan the qr code or even to log in. Recently, when using the visa card to pay, it deducted twice even the transaction is unsuccessful and it not only happened to me but happen to my other family and friends. Please do better to maintain your customer loyalty
Yesterday I installed it in my phone and it performed well. But today it suddenly freezes out and I can't login to my account. Whenever I've already entered the password and proceeded, it shows my account loged out. I tried to uninstall and install it back but it works the same. I tried using the online banking website and it surprised me by telling that I don't have user account. Today is a Sunday and the branches aren't working, so I would have one day without transactions? What a big trouble!
Having problem to access my acc. The app kept loading and giving notification to use web. But when i tried login through web, it says i am already logged in due to the app despite the app already been closed. Tried to go back to the app, i got access denied! Been in constant loop going back and forth. This is very frustrating! The app got worst upon update.
Couldnt open the apps. Delayed all my tasks. New comments: I noticed that the problem occurs when I use wifi. Once I switched to my mobile data the apps works just fine. Wonder why. I hope the developer can look into this issue. Thanks Another new comments: app asked for udpates. After updates needs to re-register. Continue to fail to register after more than 5 attempts (tries in different days and time, install uninstall, restarting phone). Please, can developer do something about it...
As the apps ALWAYS server error, I decided to use the web instead.. Unfortunately, any online transaction i need to approve via this non-functional app too. In the end, I need to opt for another banking account instead. It's time to terminate my account, i guess. What's the point if the online platform can't be used during this digital era.
13/1/23-Endless loading when i opened the app. Might be because the new update, at least around that time. . . 15/1/23-Work okay so far after reinstall it. For others who did not know, the app only work on single device. In my case, I used the app on multiple device before, and just realise it only can use on one device at a time, this maybe for user security too.
After update the apps, worst and the apps is very hasle and time consuming to deal with. Apps keep crashing and always appear "unable to connect" and take time for login. Feel very dissapointed and frustating to us while using this apps. Each time upgrade it still slow and please ensure the apps is easily convience for us to use.
This app starts to get slower and slower. Can't even share receipt to whatsapp for whatever reason. Whenever i try to scan qr code from my gallery, the app restarts itself and sometimes I can't scan my finger print for faster log in. Even if i do get to scan my finger print, it takes ages to load. I dont know why so please fix this app.
I barely can log in. The LOADİNG was always taking forever! When it does logged in, every single click to proceed with different services will take another LONG LOADİNG and most of the time I got kicked out or the time sessions expired before I could complete them! 😔 Please do fix it or I have no option but use another online banking 🙃!
The transition is a bit slow & login with biometric also slow. I wish that the app will improves the swiftness of transition from one page to another & also, i hope it never neglect user's security in all aspects. Keep on improving.
Salam. I faced the problem in log in. After key in the correct User ID, the apps seems crash and instantly back to phone menu. I do refer to the nearest branch and contact center but they could not give a solution to the problem. They always said to have up to date apps n for sure i did update the apps. The branch officer said mybe my phone the old version phone n the storage was full....hellooooo!!! I dont have any problem with my acc as i still can access via browser but cant do in bimb go.
Website is much more stable to use, and more reliable. Now the server is down, and I don't know why. I like using it to do transfers and DuitNow QR, even checking balance often. Please fix this soon. But the SecureGO is inconvenient, I had a crash once and I cannot approve payment. Maintain the SMS codes for the website, unless the transaction is through the app.
I got kicked out from the apps when I try to log in. And ive been trying for many times. I think it's not just me, everyone else also face the same problem. Please fix this. It's troublesome to use the website but that's the only option since this apps does not works well. Thanks
I cant share the pdf of my transaction, i thought it was just a bug, that will be fixed after an updates, already went through 2 updates but still not fixed? There also no sections for troubleshooting or somewhere that let u ask when u have a problem with the app. The app was fine until i cant download my pdf. Its just too inconvenience to people using the app.
Couldn't log in to this app, and apparently there's update available. Tried to update but pending for hours. So I uninstalled the apps, restart my phone and tried to re-install. But until now it's still pending installation. I don't have any problem updating/installing other apps. So now I don't even have the apps, and have to login in web version
Was working fine until one day it just decided to give up on me. I can't access my account It just gives me a loading screen. I thought reinstalling it might help, but nope. Now it just shows me the Get Started page every time. When I click on it, only blank screen is shown.
Very bad. Everytime open the apps, the system will loading and buffering. In one day this happens quite all the time. Problem is transaction above RM200 needs secure confirmation from the apps but the apps cannot be openned. WORST WORST WORST internet banking apps. Please improve otherwise people will not put money in your saving account.
The performance is really bad. It always dissapointed to open the app as almost all the time it was not function. Already reinstall to many times, but it still same after a few days. Please make it the performance as previous. Previously, it was really easy to access this apps.
I have worst experience with this new updated apps. I already update my phone, my phone is still new. Already clear cache. Already switch to mobile data or wifi but i still experiencing loading error and server error. I dont how to give feedback anymore. Already uninstall and install it back but still doesn't solve the problem that i experienced. You guys have to take this seriusly 😌 if you want to make an apps you have to make sure it user friendly and usable. Dont make us frustrated
Unable to open the apps at all after setting up on the phone. Everytime have to install and reinstall. When i use the website, require the GO aunthentication, but cannot open the apps. Keeps on loading and crashing. Before this the apps is more stable. Please fix this fast. Its so hard to do transaction.
Had problem login with fingerprint, developer responded to reenable the Quick Touch and it works now. On another matter, there's a lot of work to be done if they want to compete with other mobile banking apps but for its current iteration, I think it's quite good.
What is wrong with this app? I've been using bank Islam for a year now but only the previous version worked and not the latest one😡 It kept showing server and stuck on loading screen everytime I opened it! I also uninstall and reinstalled it several times but still not working😡👎🏻 what the heck?(edit: Now it became extremely slow😡 why?! So annoying!!)
Lagging. Takes too long to even open the apps. Even if it's not peak hour or date or whatever. Biometric fingerprint doesn't usually available. An app is supposed to be convenient and efficient. You lack both.
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME! A month & counting, no progressive updates from developer! I've tried everything you asked for, reinstall the apps but nothing works. Quite a shame, overall quite friendly but not really reliable as to date. Please remove the function of verification via Go if you're not addressing this problem yet. Really wish this can be fix ASAP.
What happen? After logged in, always error pop out.. I've been cleared all the cache many times, uninstall everything and start again.. Yet the issue still happening. This is the worst banking apps ever.. Please get your technical team fix this for the convenience of other customer. You should hire a better apps developer team!
The app is not useful at all as it always crashes or keep loading for a long time. The developer is keep stating that they're improving the app but there's no improvement till now. We as a user can't use the app to do any kind of transaction during emergency time also.
I cannot even open the app. I uninstalled and reinstalled multiple time but it's all the same. I cannot open the app. It keeps loading. I cannot do fund transfers because I am told to approve the transaction on the app, but I cannot open the app. This happened too many times. Do something about the app. Or give us an option for the IAC when we want to do fund transfers
The time taken to load the app was too long and its very inconvinient when I try to make transactions using QRpay. Please improve the user experience as it is used by so many people. Or just try to make a whole different app that's better in every way. Looking foward to that.
Copy & paste function is not available. This is one of the most important features need to be added. The UI/UX design also got problem ; the contrast etc. pls look back at the basic principles of design.
Updated the apps few weeks back and now am not able to screenshot my transaction anymore. I get that we can share it, but if I forgot then there's literally no way to just get them anymore from the app. I need to open in browser and screenshot from there. So much work to do and very annoying.
I wanted to fund transfer to another account. But at the very last page, the app doesn't cross check and display the official name of the recipient account? It simply trusts the recipient's name I put whilst trasnferring? It's terribly unreliable and unsafe. Unproffessional and unbelievable.
Ive been using this app for like half a year or so. Everything was fine until last two days, it required an update so i did and suddenly the app started to take a longer time to respond and open. Not only that, after the loading, it crashed. I feel so mad about this because we already in an era where qr code banking is a must but an app which must fulfill the needs does not function well. Im disappointed.
Worst app ever. Its been 2 months i've tried to access the app but connection server error has been appearing. Please get ur server fixed. It is not user friendly at all. I have to keep on going to the bank to do certain transaction which this was suppose to be made on online instead.
It's been more than a month i still could not login into the app even though after i had uninstall and install it back repetitively. The app keeps on showing error all the time which makes it difficult for me to go cashless. Please fix this as soon possible.
Worst banking app ever. Just opening the app your greeted with loading screen with an infinite loading time. After that when you try login your account you will have to wait again with the loading screen. Your lucky if you even manage to log in even twice a day without any problem. The app is slow when just about to do transaction, QR payment ot changing the settings. Reinstall and clearing the cache is obviously not working. So overall worst banking app ever.
Stuck at loading screen, clear cache then ok for a bit but then stuck again. Why do i need to clear cashe every damn time? DuitNow qr will need to reset transfer limit everytime clear cache. Duitnow qr camera is distorted as if the camera is squeezed. Qr detection is garbage, the scanner will show error message when im not even scanning anything, clicking OK on errror pop up will pop up another failed to scan error message. I only use this app to transfer with duitnow and I cant even do that
Worst experience ever. This is my first time downloading this app. I can't log into the app. The app will turn off or kick me out the app after i try to submit my password.. I tried updating my phone and somehow it worked, I can enter the app, but another problem emerge😅. When I use qr code, it says that i dont have any bank account even though i have one. It even suggested me to register my bank account.
So tired.. the apps keep crashing and it's currently unavailable. When they first release the apps, there's minor problem and it's inconvenient to transfer money but the issue is fixed now. But then now the apps keep crashing and I'm a disappointed user
Cant even log in to the app after last update. Keep saying unable to sync cant connect lah apa lah. Very bad. Such a shame because the app itself is good enough. Just the recent unable to log in stuff so if cannot lon in then what use is an app? I see everyone also struggling with this issue not just me. Fix before i change to another bank
Problem after updating the Apps. Before, i'm not having any problem with the app, but yesterday, after updating the apps, pop up 'unable to connect the server' showing up. No matter how frequent i turn off & restart my handphone, it is still the same. It's getting annoying as i need to make money transaction asap. Preferably i don't want to use the website as i want to transfer to other bank immediately. Please....fix this Bank Islam Go.....
I can't even make a proper transaction without the app lagging on the other end. The app used to be good and was easier to login. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app because it said 'unable to connect to server'. I hope this bug will be fixed as soon as possible.
The loading screen took so long. I can't even enter the login page, yet when I tried to login it will took so long to loading results to " We're having bad traffic " pop-up shown multiple times. Very bad app for multi billionaire company, even the beginner devs can do better application than this one.
Whenever I try to open the app, the words 'Unable to connect to server' pops out and I've been disappointed ever since. Why doesn't it work? Well, that's for the team to figure out and for us to wait in anticipation. So it's best if you GO and do it. Get it? GO and do it? No? Ok. Still frustrated with the app tho. 1 star, very bad.
Another hassle. A whole more inconvenient. You think i need more apps in my phone when a browser can do pretty much everything. No instructions how to start and i can't even get past the login page. Give a damned instructions, a simple one so the not so it savvy can do it too.
The worst and stupidest banking app ever. Logging in takes forever and sometimes can't even logged in. Error messages pop up here and there. Super slow make heart boil everytime I use the app. Why bother develop an app when customer can't even have ease of heart using the app. Worst experience. Period!!!
Currently very very annoyed right now. It has been two days! I cant transfer using the app, and if i want to transfer using the web, they ask to get the verification via the app?? U can just ask for tac no! Two days im stuck!!!! Helloooooo i have bills to pay meney to transfer!!! The apps stated "system is currently unavailable, please try later" and proceed to state " the connection is not secured, request cannot be secured" seriously what kind of connection are u referring to???!!!! Fix this
The app gets very buggy starting on November and I'm always stuck at the loading screen (before the login one). I have uninstalled it once and reinstall it again, but still the problem persists. Fix your app Bank Islam if you really want us users to ditch the web version of it. Even the web version I can't get a receipt after any kind of payment
Current update not working. Everytime I enter the apps, a pop up saying server error occured. This has happened since the last update and I have not be able to login using the apps since then. Please fix the current update so that there will be no more inconvenience later.
The apps is too easy to installed and user friendly. In term of security is quite weak. The most bad thing about this app, it's always have unstable connection, i was unable to access it for few days since its failed to connect to server. 🥲🥲
After the update, it took me few minutes to log in. I open other online bank apps and its working fine. So it's not my internet problem. After waiting few minutes to log in, it log out by itself a few seconds after i log in. It's better to log in into their system via chrome or Firefox rather than use their app. It's hard for users to use this app when in hurry. Please fix this issue please ASAP.
This is horrible. I can't access my account. Wanted to make transaction but needed to change transaction limit, that required me to approve the change in the app but I can't even LOGIN. Uninstalled and installed back..high traffic volume pulak. Don't make an app if you can't do decent maintenance.
App always loading after update last week. Stuck at log in page. Dunno wht happen. I uninstalled the app n install back, the problem cannot solved. I've been use this app since last year but this latest update is so unconvinced. The app should be user friendly with high security but this app totally different. Do something please.
This app is useful but I have problem where it cant be open a lot of times. After I open it, it just keep loading. I have to uninstall and install it back everytime this happen. This could probably be the app needing an update but would like dev to prompt it instead of me reinstalling it everytime. Thanks
The systems are really bad , poor & slow. Seriously , slow to access. Please do update/upgrade. Really bad. Even , i can't log in into my own account it keeps loading. Need some improvement for this. Really disappointed. Today , I've topup for my friend my money has been deducted but he haven't received the topup yet , it shows Succesful but NADA. Hope will see changers without clashing. Thank you 😣
Clearing the cache and reinstalling does nothing, I still cannot access the app since the latest update version. And I had no problem with my WiFi connection. Pls revert back to older version if the newer version is not ready.
Everything with this apps or bank seems to be delayed. Fund transfer has been delayed because of weekend as it is IBG, top-up reload has been delayed because of unknown reason. Been waiting like crazy, if I know about this, it must be much faster to just take out the money from the ATM and settle all of my things at once. Installing this to makes life easier, but seems like that's not the case. Very disappointed.
Interface hard to understand. I want to delete my previous fav acc but cant find the button. I want to direct debit into my TH acc. First, I do it on website but restricted and advised I should download GO apps. Try on apps but cant find the page. Hard to navigate. The only easy one is to transfer money. If I want to managed my acc, its hard to done it on apps. Useless
The most buggy app that I had ever encountered. Slow to start, login problem with error "unable to connect to the server". The only reason I had to install this is because the need for verification from the app for fpx payment. PLEASE, just send TAC code to mobile number instead of needing to use this horrible app. New edit : Is the server for this app even up? I kept having issues with "cannot connect to the server". Seriously just get rid of this trash app if so lazy to maintain the app.
1) No way to make transfer to accounts other than favourite account. 2) Furthermore, addition of a favourite account is not possible through the mobile app, there is no relevant selection to authorise the addition even after being directed from the online banking website. Perhaps a more user friendly way to authorise the addition of a fav account is by sending a code to a verified phone number or email address. Please resolve both issues asap as the app is not user friendly at all at this point.
It is so not convenient. Why bother making an apps if I have to go back to website to add fav acc then go back to apps for transfer? The apps should make it able to all acc. And today I tried to make a transaction to my fav acc list but the transaction is pending. Idk. Maybe it is under maintenance or what?? The money already deduct from acc. It just the process is pending. Help me out. Thanks!
Latest update (Jan2022) - I'm having problem on opening the app from the start. It's weird the app ask me to update to the latest version but when I clicked the UPDATE button it jumped to my playstore and it shows no update since I've set it auto-update. Then, I press BACK, the app seems blank and can't use it at all. Please fix this ASAP. This is getting me worried since I have to check my account frequently.
Good for a start, and alhamdulillah finally what I've been waiting for since first I registered for bank islam. Thank you very much to the developers team on doing this. As I've gone through the reviews, the supports and developer are actively communicating back to the users, so that's a star from me. My comments for the interface is, based on my experience, it's better to have that More Options (six dots in the bottom right corner) to be placed alongside the top-up options on the bottom menu.
I never leave a review on Google Play, but this one, I feel obligated to make one. I have to let everyone know that this is the most useless, yet important apps I've ever download in my life! Everytime I need to make a transfer, I need to open this apps for approval. Yet, the apps kept loading endlessly. Thank you for making my life miserable.
We have to reinstall everytime when need to use this app to get the infinite login loading bugs away. This is the worst app for online banking. And no, don't tell us to reinstall or clear cache or any kind of self troubleshoot ever again. Just go fix your bugs already. 🤦🏻‍♀️
Very poor. Really disappointing because couldn't use it when there's an emergency to do the online transaction.. I even can't open the app it's always showing that server error for past few months.. really hoping that you will improve the system asap :⁠-⁠(
The best banking app ever. Why you might ask ? Because even me, myself couldn't get past through the loading screen, even scammers would not even get through this app too, good job, keep everyone out from entering and using the app. Edit : The suggested "Clear Cache" doesn't even help in this case, tq.
I can't see the amount of my savings in the app compared to the website...I can see the amount😭. As a beginner I totally cried a lot that there's no money in it. Then I checked on website...This app aren't user friendly at all. Please fix this😭🙏.As someone who is new to this definitely confusing ad stressful.
I have been experiencing multiple errors and technical issues with your app many times, in almost every transaction I made. Has been happening almost a year plus now. Reading through the reviews by other users, where some had written the same complaints in few year back, it is quite surprising to know that other than admitting the problems and ensuring an improvement to your customer, there is still no positive changes. Do you think this is funny?
What a worse experience using this app. Before it was stable until the recent update makes it super hard to launch app and endless loop of loading time and slow app response. Been thinking to terminate BIMB just for this app is so slow and unresponsive most of the time and I mostly use online banking this is a troublesome for me. So, please fix this app you will lose alot of your customers because of this app alone
Useless... Annoying... Everytime when in urgent need to use this useless apps it will give u hard times. Really useless.
"Rooted device. Can't launch application" What does it means?
every time you want to use, there must be an issue, error traffic too high, or unable to connect to server, app crash end up use browser. The app is getting worse every time it is updated.
Lately I am having a problem with sharing any transaction via WhatsApp. Everytime any transaction, I always click the share button, sent via WhatsApp, transaction statement will be sent with pdf document. Now it fails when I click the share button. There is a statement stating pdf fails to be downloaded. Not sure whether it is my phone settings or the server
I think I saw MANY reviews saying how bad the app is. Especially AFTER pressing UPDATE. Initially it was fine, I like how it's user-friendly. However, the first problem I encounter is I cant use the QR scan by scanning code from gallery. I have to directly scan the code from my friend's phone, or from the shop's counter. THEN, the other day I cant open the app, so it asked me to update. BUT, AFTER UPDATE, it keep saying 'UNABLE TO CONNECT TO SERVER'. Excuse me? App developer? DO YOUR JOB!
This is my 2nd review. Lately the app has been useless. The app does not load. This began after receiving and update. Not sure what ya'll did to ruin the perfectly functioning app. Received an email to clear cache, but to no avail. The problem persists, Please do something.
Apparently, the buggy, hard to load app wasn't enough. Now they made new update to force you transaction by installing this app, supposedly to "make it more secure" yet doesn't even show the display number, making the progress even slower. I'm beyond annoyed. This will be especially an unnecessary burden for those whose in rush to pay things or in urgent
Server lambat gila tak habis2 nak login and loading page tu pun lama, its better if online banking xyah connect to this app, it only hinder the process if this keeps up
It keeps on crashing. Difficult to switch it on when i am in the needs to use it. But its ok since i can do the transcation by web. However, worse come to worse when we need to approve everything via the same apps that always hang. It takes forever for me to transcact a money. Please do something.
Everytime update, become much slower. Did u guys make improvement or decommissioning the apps? Every urgent thing make it slower demnn so hard.
I'm using this app okay so far, but I just want the developers to fix or improve one thing, which is the length of words can be written on "Recipient Reference" and "Other Payment Details" when transferring money. This problem is really putting me at disadvantages as I can only write a few words. I cannot detail any reason or statement to my payees. So, please fix this problem as soon as possible. Yes, I'm running on above Android 7.0, I'm on Android 11. I shouldn't be facing this problem.
This app is really useless. After key in all the id, password, ic & 6 digit tac number, it says "unable to process, please contact the bank. Not user friendly at all. Please don't waste your time to download it. Really useless and waste of time. Call the bank and they also have not resolved the issue instead ask me to use the normal website to login.
This bank app by far is the worst. PLEASE FIX YOUR APP !!! It is so inconvenient. Crashes all the time. And the interface is so not user friendly. Another thing, was asked to update the app then when i did it totally cannot worked stated that the server error.
Very slow and bad service make my payment time so long and loading so long long times. Better than uninstall this app
I dont usually complaint but this time, Im getting fed up with this app!!!!!!!! I can't even log in. I use Samsung S23U, so i dont think there is a problem with my phone nor my connection. I CAN NOT EVEN OPEN THE APPS. There are a series of events that people have to wait for me to figure out my banking apps coz i can not open it so I can not pay. Please fix it as it's getting worse!!!!!!! If there is 0 star, i would give 0
Hi, it's still happening. Since past few months, this buggy app still cannot open or login. Not only app, on website too. I had to use other bank account because of this. Note that: this is not due to poor internet connection. Other mobile banking apps works perfectly, only bank islam face problems. I already clear cache and still the same is happening. Not only me, other users i know are facing the same thing. 😌
To be honest, this new update on november is so disappointed. Can't even get into the app because of the stupid *server error* notification keep appearing. Its so annoying. Now, if I want to get access to online banking I need to go to the website. That's alot of step to go through. Also all verification that need the user approval through the go app seems impossible right now.
People should have the option to transfer money using the web interface and not be forced to download an app just to complete a transaction. It's stupid and tedious. Edit: Just realise I cannot check transaction history. Nothing comes up. Only details of money going out can be seen. No details on money coming in. Shortsighted design. Very idiotic.
Worse banking app ever. Not functioning at all. Can't even appear login page !! (Error 500)
Honestly, i would say this does not deserve a star. Why ? Because how could i rate it when it could not be used at all ? Just like the others, I faced the same issue. " Unable to Connect to Server" right after I installed the new version. The website ? Oh cmmon.. the system always down and it's very inconvenient. Please do something about it.
Bila update app latest, terus tak boleh buka,, loading je mmnjang..
I wanna say that please fix the bug and loading issues, whoever is incharge with this need to update their systems and always heavy on traffic. Took lots of time to just load a single screen, and it's a waste of time.
After installing the new app, it has been so hard to open in because it kept on stuck at the starting. Most of the time shows connection failure, server failed et cetera. So far this is the worst bank app I had ever installed or use.
I cant open after updating the apps..
This app always cannot open, stuck, slow , cannot connect to server. It's so terrible and sucks. Whoever is the developer of this app, please fix it ASAP! I only use this bank because I'm still a student. I will not recommended this app or bank islam to anyone. Their service was so bad. What's the point to update it just for it to turn into slower and worse so ever!
Please la Bank Islam..do something about your GO apps..you want to force people using it, so please make it better!!!!!! If people want to use it but it keeps loading FOREVER!!! And often cant be use becouse YOU EXPERIENCE HIGH AMOUNT OF USER?? JUST SHUT DOWN THE APPS IF YOU DONT HAVE MONEY TO INVEST FOR IT AND MAKE IT BETTER. JUST STICK TO THE WEBSITE. NOW YOU MAKE IT HARD FOR YOUR CUSTOMER TO DO ANY TRANSACTION!! THAT JUST SO STUPID. PLEASE DO SOME CHANGE!!
it was smooth before. however, since Nov 22, it gets into problem. most of the time cannot acess, stuck with the loading logo endlessly. i have emailed the Bank Islam contact center and replied that newer version is available. However, uninstalled and installed the new version, problem still persistent.
Annoying. Request authorize thru apps tapi apps asik problem je -_-
I've been waiting for a day to use the app and it's not working at all STUPIDDDD Can you guys make it better faster!
I have been with bank islam for close to 20 year and always had a pleasant experience. I never had issues with the app before but of late, with your new updates, the app is not opening, lagging at start up and it is irritating when i cannot perform online banking. I have to uninstall, install many times and yet still the same. Please do the needful and ensure your customer satisfaction is not compromised!
I can't login and then when I managed to login, it said system unavailable or error. The transaction takes too long and then it cancels it due to the errors or system unavailable. I tried using browser and then it asked me to confirmed in the GO app but then I CAN'T OPEN THE APP, EVEN WHEN I CAN OPEN IT, THE CONFIRMATION TOOK TOO LONG THAT THE TRANSACTION TIMED OUT. PLEASE IMPROVE OR YOU COULD JUST LET THE CUSTOMERS USE TAC NUMBER INSTEAD OF SECURE VERIFICATION. THANK YOU.
I'm gonna rate 1 star for now. I've been using this apps for years now and I've always loved it. But now i couldn't open the apps as it kept on saying "unable to connect to server". I've tried to reinstall again yet I still faced the same problem. Pls fix this asap!
Everything is actually great until a few weeks ago when i can't open the apps. No response at all. I tried refreshed my phone, closed all other apps I'm using buy nothing. I thought that i need to update the apps but checking the apps at google store, there's no new update. So I don't know what to do. I need to open browser to check my account. Now I need to update the apps. Let's see if I can open or not, the apps after updating it.
Last month I tried opening the app but it just wont open. Today, I tried again and am shocked to see that the app still wont launch. I'm not able to authorize any transaction and has to go to the bank. It's very frustrating and inconvenient.
Unable to conect to server issue. Tried clearing cache. Issue persist. Cleared apps data (without uninstalling) and login again. Issue solved. Although was prompted with 'invalid id' at first. Have a try. Not sure if the issue will come back. Developer pls fix this bug.
I think it's okay... but i really don't like it when they ask you to update & i've updated the app, i couldn't access the app later. Can really make ppl panic since everytime i tried to access the app, app couldn't get through the server. I had to uninstall the app & install it again. I really don't want to re-do it again everytime the app need to be updated. This need to be fix.
The apps is not functioning at all, there's nothing going on if I open the apps, just the pink cakground and that's it. Not even log in, the button for that is nowhere to be seen. Its been like that for weeks, but I still try to uninstall than install it back, still the same. Hope you cam improve the system.
Difficult to access. Loading for long time. Very irritating. If i could rate ZERO STAR, i would
Please improve the app. It takes a long time to open the app, and it takes even longer to make a simple transaction.
Bad. I want to transfer using online banking, has to download n login to apps to approve. When login to apps, its automatically logoff the online banking. And it's goes on an on. Want to transfer by apps, cannot. No account registered. Favourite account already exists in online, but not exists in apps and asked me to add in online. Why la? When tye loops going to end, i don't know and i don't care. Don't wanna use both anymore
Loading until time out. Other bank apps work well and fast, but GO BI apps, very disappointing.
This app does not entitled any star. Worst experienced ever. The website is much better than apps. Problems with go secure is that after you key in digits given, the transaction will not proceed. The app will log out and i had to log in again. So irritating.
Always does not work!. Sometimes it was like forever to wait this app from buffering.
Force us to use this broken app for duit now, never gonna fix anything broken on this app... the rating also so low and did not improve anything... What ur guys problem... Stuck on stone age, never gonna improve anything... Turning blind eye event many comments on this app are negative....
Your GO app is really unreliable. GoSecure frequently hangs, causing me to be unable to complete transactions. Frustrating! The app also takes a really long time to load (5 minutes wait and it is still loading!) Henceforth when I tried logging on on a desktop, the page declined saying I was logged on somewhere else! Bank Islam, your app developer really slacks. For a bank app to be this untrustworthy speaks volume about your institution. Do something right now before you lose more customers!
I cannot login no matter how many times I reinstall the app. It keeps on showing "Unable to process your request. Please try again." over and over. Update: Now on 7 January 2023. The problem still persists despite following the advice. Cleared the cache, uninstall and install the latest version, the same problem "Unable to process your request. Please try again." over and over.
Very frustrated with this app. Already installed and reinstalled many times over but to no avail. Stucked at good morning page. What irritates me more is the way the developer addressed this VERY IMPORTANT issue by just cutting & pasting the same answer all over again. Complainers have done the install/reinstall processes, gave access to location and even called the said support number but problem still persists.....PLEASE FIX THE PROBLEM ASAP and STOP replying nonsense!!!
very bad app. bank islam needs to do something with this problem. can't even load!! internet banking's suppose to make things easier for user, not harder.
Terrible apps. Cant login after many attempts. The message said done registering but the app keep loading. Clear all cache, restarting phone. But nothing work. Very annoying since online transaction through website also need this app to approve. Please ensure the apps would be better than previous version before launch new update. If cannot be better than previous, just stick at old version or using TAC number. Please do solve this problem as fast as possible!
The worsting apps I been used, the system soooo lag and for the first register I been sign up for half hour just bcz ur system is super lag n cannot recognizer user! Hence, when I use for transfer, the authorisation also lag. Very bad experience! If your apps n system is not mature pls don't launched the apps, just keep for using the website n IT department pls focus on how to gain website security! I even don't want to give a star.
Too long to enter. Too long to load. Cant do transaction. Worthless update.
The load takes forever... Is there anyone can fix this matter? Or would it stay like this forever?
Bad experienced and never try to fix their issue. Too slow to open it.
Worst app ever. The previous still can consider enven there is up and down. I have to instal & uninstall more than 10 times but still unable to open the app. Not sure if the app was created by whom. Might be primary school student I guess
Very bad experience since the last update. I can't open the app since a month though. I thought the developer will handle this professionally and efficiently, but it's just a dream I guess... They don't even bother the 1 star rate😌.. VERY BAD APPLICATION
Apps yg paling banyak masaalah. Tak pernah nak improve comment user. Shame to islamic bank app. Masaalah server lah aper bagai. Menyusahkan user. Lebih baik tukar islamic bank yg lain. Ayat 'WE ARE CONSTANTLY WORKING TO IMPROVE OUR SERVICE .....' give the big hope but the actual 'KELAUT' until now still got problem and nothing improvement done by service provider..... don't know when the problem can be resolved.
I'm always stuck at the loading screen, and it appears a few times when going back and forth throughout the apps, not when just starting it up. I can't do business when everything is slow and stuck.
You can enter the apps, everytime open it always shown problem with server. Then I open internet banking from website at laptop. Become worst, the transaction require approval from the Apps in the phone. What the hell??? How i want to transfer money, pay bills and so ever. Useless apps.
This system need to be improved. I think about change other bank because of this. A simple transaction become complicated. When need to pay or transfer to other account but need approved through app GO bank islam.. but it was lag too long.. This system should be friendly user like other banking app such as m2u and CIMB click. This system really bother when need urgent transaction.. Bank Islam need to learn from other banking like Maybank and CIMB how to improve your system.
Worst bank app. Can't even be open. The more it update the more I kept on getting server error message. You need to have NASA level computer in order to use this stupid app. And even then I can't guarantee you can actually open it. In fact, I don't even know if they even know what NASA computer is since how so dated and backward Bank lslam is. I haven't even started about their poor services and bad UI design. Can't even view my own card transaction histories.
Always keep loading, wasting a lot of time. Kindly improve on it.
Trash apps. Trash bank. Even online transaction need to verify trough apps very inconvenient and troublesome to use. I don't even want to say what's wrong with this apps. The developers doesn't event try to improve. Worse experience ever!!
After I update the app a week ago, this app has become useless. I even unistalled and installed it back. The problem still persist though. Cannot use it at all and everytime I tried to login there is always error message appeared saying " the app is currently experiencing a high volume of traffic ".. Really?
Always will have issue with it. And I can't see my balance. It will show unable to connect to server. Like everytime you wanna use the app it will have its issues which is so ridiculous. What is the developers doing with this amount of feedback aren't they supposed to come with and update???. So frustrating to use this app which is so useless.
Its worse apps. Always loading at the end cannot enter cause of error. Please upgrade apps.
It's very slow and shows a lot of error. I was trying to transfer money to my friend and the app logged out by itself. It's hard to pay with QR scan because I have to wait more than 5 minutes
Before the update last year, this apps was great... Then after the end of october 2022, i can't use it anymore after it updated into the new version... Everytime i try to key in my data, it shows up #400 Bad Request... I had call the customer service to fix it up but it remain same
Worst Bank-Apps ever. Took 2-3 days to log-in. Sometimes longer than that. Worst on payday. Have to uninstall, and then reinstall, so that can log-in. But the problem will repeat itself again and again. The bank never upgraded this app. Makes millions of profit, but apps macam sampah. Other banks never had this kind of problems.
Assalamualaikum, the app always crash whenever I open it. But after I update my phone operating system "Android OS", I finally get to use it properly, so far no problem for me. I finally can pay my flight tickets. Anyone reading this, I hope this is useful for you too. You should update your phone's OS before using this app. Or maybe update every single system app in your phone.
Just wanted to let the devs know that the app was not able to connect to the BIMB server after the latest update. I tried updating, clearing cache, clearing storage and nothing works. It only worked again after reinstalling the app. I loved the app but it will be even more amazing if the GUI is more fluid, though that's just me being picky. Hopefully the next update is smooth as it's been a recurring issue. Kudos to the devs.
Please fix the app. Sometimes it takes time to load, unable to connect to server but when accessing internet banking through the browser works just fine. A few times I had to reinstall the app just to fix the server error. It annoys me because clearing cache doesn't help at all to reset the connection to server. Why is that a problem? Basically the app becomes completely useless when the error starts popping up, reinstalling is the only option. We use this almost daily now.
Previous version apps are more batter than current apps. After I updated to a new apps the apps seems having a bad issues. 1. It is hard to open, and it takes more time to open. Loading too long. 2. Even though1 managed to log in, when I choose, as an example, to transfer a money, the apps will be loaded again, and it takes a long time to load. 3. Not so friendly like before, because when I would like to check other things inside the apps, the same issue happens. Please make changes
NOT USER FRIENDLY AT ALL!!! Last review, 1 star on December 2022, until today Nov 2024, this apps does not improve much. They include fingerprint to make the access easier, but not easy at all. I can easily access to see ny account with 1 time using fingerprint eith other banking apps, but not with this app. To open each section, it loading for so long. To get approval for transaction also take some time. What's the point moving to 5G era, but your app still slow.
for the past week I couldn't get pass the starting screen of the app and thus i can never access the app anymore. i have checked if there's any update but there were none and my phone meets the app requirement system. the web browser works fine but it is frustrating bc i can't use the app anymore to do instant transfers. fix this issue please this is too absurd
The app is so slow, and it will not open at all. I have to uninstall the app and reinstall it every time i want to use the app. After reinstalling, I can only use it once. The second time I try to use it, the same thing happens, and I will have to uninstall again. After reinstalling the app, I can't make any transfers to other banks for the next 12 hours. I feel like closing my account just because of this. This app is not convenient at all. In fact, it is troublesome to the users.
Cannot launch the app. Tried everything and yet the login page never appear, stucked at the front page forever. Read the latest reviews, and the developer keep on telling to update to latest version (3.2.09), which is what everyone already have update to, or use phone with android 9 and above. No solution or whatsover. Very disappointed with how little they care about clients' experience.

PLEASE DO SOMETHING TO THE APPS!! after installed the updated version, it is always loading and stuck at the start up n i cant open the apps. Update on 28 oct 2023, i believe there is no improvement that bank islam done to their apps, which is super non friendly user, lagging, need to open and log in several times, i almost forget my password because rarely use it due to the issues.
Too many errors occuring from time to time Either not being able to log in, not able to use the QR, and even worse, not even able to open the apps even after waiting for quite some time. Had to uninstall then reinstall the app. It is annoying as you need to enter your data all over again
i will close my account because if this incompetent app. now that you force to use app to validate any transfer but it does not even connect. i have clear cache, update, uninstall and reinstall before you even try to ask for me to update this app. even tried with wifi and my mobile 5G speed. this is just pure garbage of an app.
Why i kept getting error "400 bad request", although i already key in my correct password and id also the tac number. After that error, the app send me msg that i already registered yet unable to to log in. Please resolve this, i already uninstall and reinstall for several time.. Dear BIMB, Again this app really needs improvement. As from all customers that seems to have the same issues, we really need you to solves it fast for us to used it again.
Please please please do stg about the app start up, I can't open the app no matter how many times I tried, and since some transcation require verification from this app it's really frustrating! Why in the world does everything need verification from the app anyway, the duitnow I get, the jompay I get, but why funds transfer too????
Too slow, the app keep loading and in the end, the session expired just like that. One more thing... it keeps telling us to UPDATE BUT NOTHING'S CHANGED!! STILL THE SAME PROBLEMS OCCUR WHILE USING THE APP!! Please make improvement on the app so that IT WILL BE EASIER FOR US, THE USER OF THE APP!!
Useless app !  Most of the time take time to load unable to connect to server. It's really frustrating. I had to reinstall the app when I need to do the transaction. Annoying !!!
Sometimes it's working.... sometimes NOT. It continues to buffer. So unfriendly users. In fact my phone is new, install & uninstall 3 times by now & updated the apps to the latest version. But still the SAME prob reoccurring. Fix you apps pls!
the most stupidest banking app.. it will take forever to load. on top of that if you want to perform duitnow transfer through the browser, you still need to open your go app. it's so annoying and it really makes me angry. i have very stable internet connection. Hey bimb please learn from cimb how to operate an app.
i want to carry out fpx transaction. so i need to use go app to approve the transaction. and goes on loading till the last 120s of the transaction. and when i got at the login page press go secure to approve the transaction. it repeatly tell me the transaction has expired, when i still have 120s. i did a few more time with the same result till transaction have really expired. ok i give another go, i reinstall the app, reregistered it for 3 more time to do the fpx and it still waste my time
Very disappointing experience using bank islam go, it takes forever just to get to the log in screen, not to mention the problem while scanning qr codes and many more.. what's the point of yall taking RM 13 from our bank accounts if you didn't do anything to fix the goddamn app..no one will be furious if there is a slight inconvenience for a short period of time, but this app has been giving people nothing but trouble for quite some time..please step up your IT teams

Worst app ever exist! Very slow and u need to activate go secure even for small amount transfer. Waste of time!! Once lag, it's going to lag forever.. in the end, need to uninstall and install it again. No improvement despite people giving reviews. Don't bother to create an app if it's only cause trouble every time u need to use it!!
25/8/23: Guess I'm not changing my opinion anytime soon. Very, very rarely it was fast. Rest of the time? So slow that I forgot I have to pay for something. Now? I can't even go to the main page, keeps telling me to reinitiate transaction. WT--?? Like I have no life to live, is it, to wait for the app to actually work?
Greetings to whom it might concern. You are a bank institution. There supposedly should not be any crashes, trouble opening, and unable to connect to the server every time. Please do something about this. I am so tired of having to close and open the app every time I wanted to do transactions and approvals. Worst, re-installing for dozens of times. Thus, I had trouble making simple payments. I hope to actually use your banking app smoothly. I look foward to see some improvements.
From bad to worse. It was already laggy and slow before. Since the update, takes close to forever to load(my internet is running at 500mbps) . And the interface is very buggy. I can't do any transactions just an endless loop of returning to the home screen. I end up using chrome or my PC for any online transactions. Please this app really needs a major update & revamp. At a time when most things are online you might loose more customers bcoz other app(bank) are better
Im so proud of bank islam. Most of the time this app cannot work, always loading screen and server error. However, rather than solving this issue you guys have a great idea by making transactions approval using the go app. So if we successfully log into the portal using web browser, we still need to open the app which is 99% does not work. What a fantastic idea! Btw, stop using AI to reply all reviews. Clearing cache wil not solve anything for this garbage system
Unable to connect the server? Already update the latest version (as of 7 October 2023). Already uninstall and install again to see if it's working, but still doesn't working. If we need to call the center, every user of this app will end up calling Bank Islam. The problem is this app itself.
Not intuitive to use. I cancelled my transfer settings and press OK on the dialog option, nothing happened, not even to the homepage. I tap on back button and the app not responding at all. Can't even find ASNB account summary or related (not transaction) but the bank have that service, really not good. Edit: No error, I wrote "Nothing happened" means I got any feedback from that? No, you didn't code any error message. That's even worst.
Seriously this apps is too slow!! I can't perform a simple money transaction due to the apps just loading itself and I waited for a whole 30 minutes just for the apps to open!!! Even tho it's like that it seems like there's no improvement from the developer to upgrade their application performance... seriously a horrible experience for a cashless person like me.
The app was very very veryyyyyy slowwwwww!!!!!! Couldn't make any transactions with this app. I am beyond disappointed. Edit: after the recent update, there's no more slow loading so i think they deseve more star
Frequently got problem to share the transaction receipt. There are 2 ways to share receipt in GO apps .... thru (menu) history mobile transaction or thru individual account transaction history. Both got blank receipt. My phone OS is Android version 13. GO apps version 3.2.09.
My rating for this app has plummeted significantly lately among financial apps that I've used. Worst experience and seems buggy, it hangs frequently and randomly unresponsive, not able to connect, etc. Not easy for online payment. Getting tired of all sorts of issue for a financial apps from a Bank. Really needs to buck up and hope security is no compromised though!
Struggle to access. I had reinstall for 5th time a day. It's very hard to access. Just used website. Please fix the problem. It's make us not happy with this latest version. Actually, time to time, this apps could be easy and friendly to use. Hopefully, please go through for this problem first. This is the major problem from the others. Thank you.
Very bad apps.. Always stuck and nothing happened after wait 10 minutes. Causing me very bad experience to transfer money using western Union and PFX with your apps. Very very very bad!!!!
Took super long to open the apps. Most of the time i gave up. Would rather transfer all my money to other banks, easier when i need to do duitnow payment at the store. Im super close to stop using this app.
Often to unistall and install. Also been waiting for the IAC to be send to my number take years. Requested for so many times still did not received any In case of emergency to do any transaction, this is very much troublesome. Transaction via website also need approval from GO Bimb. How to if I can't even open the apps ?
App not responsive to touch input on landing/login page. Uninstalled and reinstalled still unresponsive, cannot tap 'get started'. Hope can fix soon.
I can see this app is improving. My only complaint is that it would be nice if this app would let guest user login using the app that already has a registered user ID. Sometimes, I'm helping my mom doing online transactions when I was at hostel, so it was troublesome to deregistered my Go bank account just to use Go secure using my mom Go bank account.
Actually not bad if you compare with other bank software. User friendly UI, Easy to use, just abit slow sometimes. Other all good for me.
I mean i understand that many people are using this app, but you have to accommodate good service to them. Make frequent maintenance, if u already did u have to make it even more frequent. Please people are just trying to get their transactions through and if u are wishing to keep them as customers, please improve.
too many bugs,slow apps eventhough signal at the area in good condition, need to improve on the apps efficiency,unable to screenshot as a evidence while performing any transaction.
the apps are so bad, clear cache, etc, still unable to open the apps. Online transactions through the website need approval through GO secure, but nothing can be approved since the apps only trying to load the entire time
If the App fails, at least makes it relinquish hold of the account. Else, one can get stuck not being able to access an account from either web client or mobile, effectively locking one out of his/her own account! Update: Reliability gets worser with every update. Daily transaction limit has mistakenly being changed from the basis of accumulated amount transferred daily to just a single transaction per-day. Might as well just close your account if you rely on mobile banking at this point.
I've already updated to the new version but still couldn't open the app.. I don't know why it cannot connect to the server. I've tried using both wifi and data but still can't open.
Very bad application. server always down. Error communication with server. Lag too long. Application did not have user-friendly. Any update did not change anything but make it worse. For technical issue, always be late and too long for maintenance. Suggestion: please improve your server, make staff trained very well for apps, do some testing apps before release it. If apps always crash, make sure ask opinions from another.
Half an hour loading to open the apps. Very very very bad apps for such a big finance company. Please let us used the browser instead of this app.. I repeat.. Very.. Very....very very.. Bad and junk apps.
Unable to login,Already clear and uninstall the app.Still get the same error. There is no more,Go secure for approve transaction purpose.It is very dangerous since no safety in online transaction. YES,this is the latest version of app.
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE fix your app sometimes it will suddenly became error and i need to reinstall it REINSTALL ITT !!! IT'S SO FRUSTRATING !!! BECAUSE I USED THIS APP FOR MY DAILY WHEN I REINSTALL IT AGAIN I NEED TO WAIT 24 HOURS TO DO THE TRANSACTION (24 HOURS 24 HOURS) YOU THINK I HAVE TIME TO WAITTTT. I already read someone chat and i read your reply . You said you already fixed it. But you lying the problem are still not fixed .
Every single time when I want to use go app , it crashed . Why can't you just like before ? Sending TAC through SMS , it's a lot more easier and after using GO app everything when really bad .
I will be honest. This app is the worst. The loading takes too long for me to open the app. If its only a minute or two is okay but it takes 5 mintues or even more just to load? I've heard the issue is not new which proves this app is just that bad.
I want to pay my uni fee, but I can't pay it through online because it's keep loading. I prefer, the old version where we just need to put code from SMS from need permission from aps. Because this app will stuck. I want to pay my uni fee!!!!
If there is an option to give 0 star, damn sure I'd give it without hesitation. Every time updates coming this app has become much much worse than before. Please fix your app and your server so we can log in without issue. Fix the damn issue asap or else we will port to another bank.
Sorry to say. Very bad and bad system ever. After update the latest one I cannot access my online banking. Always lagging all the time even though using wifi. Waste time waiting & drag my time also.
lousy lousy lousy still..updated oct 2023 . Frustrating lately since up-dating this app recently, always unable to connect. Why give us this trouble now? after many years hassle free without un-install and install. Fix this!!! Nothing being done. Stop replying me the same stupid answer like the others.
I hate this app ever.... From September until the end of October, this app can't perform well even i have updated it... I can't do anything to my money in the bank. Already made some reports via email and call centre for this issue. Seem like no action from them.
The apps took tooooo long to open since the update. It hinder all my transfer since it need go secure and the page won't open even the homepage. Please fix it asap
Please upgrade the apps. Loading time to open the apps is unstable. Sometimes it's working fine, sometime it took forever. Making it hard to perform transaction. Especially, when using Go Secure. I am able to receive notification from other apps while the apps loading for Go Secure. I believed it is not my mobile network problem. Please fix the issue. Online banking apps should be seamless as we are practicing cashless transaction for the norm.
Truly disappointed! After so many attempt trying to login with password still invalid! We only able to login with same password and username thru website using chrome browser. Please do something with your crash app!
the app just updated and now i can't even make it to the login screen because of "server error". it's a pain and i need to use the app for online and cashless transactions, do fix this problem ASAP
I have no words for how much I hate this app. Recently updated, now my transfer limit can't be changed on the app. It's a different limit from the mobile site, and it's a ridiculously low limit that I can't do anything with. Uninstalling and reinstalling for the umpteenth time and hope (yet again) that this will fix the problem.
Your notification was so bad. No information regarding the need to upgrade, uninstall and reinstall. Your sense of urgency is so bad that you not allow customer to perform transaction right after installing the app. Instead, you asked for a cooling off 12 hours? Are you running a beta version on BIMB customer? You made 12 hours of misery.
Srsly, this system must be improved. I am thinking bout changing my service bcs of this. A simple transaction bcome complicated as h*ll. Byk sgt maintanance. Yeah, a system should be frequently maintaned but the frequency of this app being maintance is just too much and sometimes so abrupt .it bother the urgent transaction. Not only that,the application has tons of problem. Slow.
cannot use during payday week, most of the time hang during transaction,go apps becomes not go apps..the 1st version way much better than current. What a dissapointed experienced!
The worst online banking app. It took so long to just open the app. It will just keep on loading I need to wait for a very long time for the app to literally open for me to do my payment. I need to open the app super early if I want to use the app. There's no nice experience for me while using this app. I really hope that your technology/it team could rework or do something to make the app run smoothly. People has been talking about this problem since forever and I can't see any improvements.
Its getting worse..i hope you guys can fix this problem..its already a couple of days but i still can't login to the apps..i always update the apps..but it's doesn't seem to be a changes at all..
This has to be the worst apps for a bank. You cannot even access and the page rotates like drops of blood oozing and oozing. Even using the website, as payment has to be made, when it transfers to the apps, the apps does not respond promptly until you have delayed payment in your waiting list. Unfortunately, has to be cancelled and switch to another bank service. This has to be the worst nightmare for Bank Islam customers. I would rate this apps zero star for incompetence, slow & irresponsive.
Worst bank app service ever. Low maintenance and really annoying to handle such simple tasks. Buffer all the time and not even a message to inform in the app have problems to be fixed.
Very frequent system hang. Then I will have to uninstall and reinstall back. Pls improve system reliability and stability. Tq 23 June 2023 Still no improvement with the apps. I still have to uninstall and re install every single time I want to access the Go apps. Worse now it says I can only do transaction 12 hours after! 3rd time already. And you can guess when I try to login after 12 hrs, the apps will just flicker forever and I have to again uninstall and reinstall back. Pls revamp the app.
After update, cannot connect to the server. Need to uninstall and install it again. Loading time too long when need to do secure pay, untill timeout. Not much improvement compare to other internet banking apps after a year from my last reviewed.
Worst ever online banking app I've ever experienced. After having to install, uninstall and reinstall, it still failed to function. Doesn't even deserve 1-star. Please buck up!! and emulate other banks' secure app that have been proven to perform, no need to reinvent the wheel, just get it sorted out before imposing on customers to use such app for our online banking transactions.
Apps Loading time during peak and non peak hours are terrible. If other banks's apps can be efficient in terms of loading time and etc, bank islam should make initiatives to develop an app that is on par with other apps. Show some class 😮‍💨
Please upgrade your apps. Tells me to update, after updating the app, it says cannot connect to the server. Need to uninstall and re-install. Tired of doing the same thing all over again...if i can give u zero star, i would. Worst banking app ever. I don't know how many times already i uninstall and reinstall your app. Don't tell me about phone spec, never encountered this problem on any other banking app. 😤
Now it's unusable. Keep giving me error code 500 (APZ_TSN_500). I did everything I could, reinstall, clear cache and data. Only work for a brief moment after I reinstall / clear data and it doesn't work after I close and try to open the app. For some reason, it works perfectly on my friends phone.
Hi again its me your customer. Recently I try to make a few purchases from tiktok shop but after the first purchase, the system started to go crazy and it can't even able to process my purchase anymore. It unfortunately cancelled out my promo payment hence why I'm rating it 1 star. Please kindly fix this issue.
I've had quite a frustrating experience with this app. Picture this: you're in the process of confirming a purchase, and you're given just one minute to do so. However, the app takes an eternity to load, and when the time finally runs out, all the items in your cart disappear, forcing you to start the search all over again. It's a situation that leaves me truly disappointed, and I believe Bank Islam should take this feedback seriously. What a shame.
I want to open the app, it takes a long time to load..then I want to transfer money, it loads again..then it is denied.. after that i must to delete the app, then download it again.. open the app, it loads again, then it is denied and I have to wait 12 hours to make the transfer.. the same thing happens over and over again.. please do something & improve your services..
Not a good option if you want to use this apps as your main account. It takes forever to load for login. I have uninstall and reinstall again. Still the same problem. Better to have another account which has more user friendly mobile apps like MAE or CIMB. Today 20/9/23 still same problem. These comments mean nothing perhaps.
Current version not user friendly. Always have an issue when try to log in and take time to load. The apps keep down whenever we try to open. Please help to fix this. Very difficult for a user to use the apps.
The app is slow because it needs a strong Internet connection. That's all. Suggestion: 1. Update the UI app to more fresh one following the trend right now (Be U can, why the official app cannot right?) 2. Make a more friendly user UI, not old school one, bold & not interesting UI.
I would give 0.5 star only If I can. This app so worse and complicated to use. It's very sensitive about the security maybe and always got some problem, trouble, issue etc and ask us to go to bank, email the bank or call bank to fix it. Other bank is better because it's easy to use unlike this app. Always give us problem even though we use it politely
I usually use mobile browser to make transfer in Bank Islam. But now you put another filter as in to approve transaction in this GO app. It's good on paper, because another security authentication is always good, BUT THIS GO APP IS ALWAYS UNRESPONSIVE. Imagine a simple transfer takes nearly an hour just to be responsive. Shame on you. It's 2023 but this app likes like it was build in 90s. And NO! I will not reach you at the email given. Step up your game or you'll lose many more users like me.
At account details page, my money are still there but it keep decreasing at home pages. It's frustrating. I can't make transaction. It keeps saying i don't have balance left
Slow loading apps. Very, very, very, slow loading apps. Not that user friendly. Always had trouble using this apps.
Pure connection. Already update handphone to android 10, but still fail to connect, although after using variety of internet line.
Loading too long. Sometimes not working. Been using for so long but the problem still the same. Never improve. Difficult when trying to pay with qr code cause need to wait for too long.
Asked me to update employment status when I tried to login through web browser but need to approve via app. Downloaded the app, but need to enable unnecessary permissions. When enabled, server connection error. Head father you, your mother green.
I tried to transfer money from using website, it refuses and ask me to use this app. But when I install the app and try to transfer, I keep getting error "You are not allowed to perform this monetary transaction for 12 hours".
The newer version app has improved a lot. No more lagging. Easy to log in. Online transfer has been easy. A+ for team effort
29th Jan 2022: GO apps keep loading for quite some time. I've updated my password and even try to reinstall it. But still the issue doesn't resolved. I've been calling customer service/support to identify what's the root cause. Can anyone from IT team able to solve it? 26th June 2023: It getting worse. Seriously it getting worse. Loading time, response time after key in password, transferring money as well (during OTP seems faster), now approving via Apps took a lot of time. Really frustrating
Unable to login after newly installed in new phone. Keeps saying connection to server is lost. Please fix. Thank you.
I cleared app cache and data. Tried again. Its working. Thank you. Just that the tag that comes in into the phone only works at the second attempt.. not the first.
Edit Again: Alhamdulillah the app nowadays is usable enough. They get rid of the useless feature that caused the app unusable in the previous version
Notice that there is improvement on the application, especially it is much faster than before, which makes QR payment is possible. Keep up the good work.
Transfer all my money to bimb because i lost my Maybank card. Now i cannot do any online transaction due to this app keep on loading till kiamat. Damn very sucks. Why need approval from this app when your system very bad. Nak beli makanan pon cannot pay using qr pay
Please upgrade you apps. Very slow. Unable to do transaction especially paying bill etc.. Thinking to migrade to other bank if no action taken to solve the problem
Simple, yet full of features. Unfortunately, not 5-star as it's sometimes difficult to access.
I love the app although they have problem loading quite a lot. I use it mainly because i connect it to the tabung haji. But i cant do it anymore. Why is that?
Deserves no star. Time is of the essence when it comes to financial transactions, but with this app constantly crashing, it defeats the whole purpose of having an app for financial transaction. Don't introduce an app if it cannot serve it's purpose. What is the point of me having to approve online banking transaction on the go app if the go pp constantly crashes??? No transaction can go through? Just stick to the code being sent to your phone???
Very slow. Every day I will uninstall and reinstall back. Than need to wait another 12hrs for transfer. Poor app. Why keep continue such services. Very sorry. Very frustrating.
Unable to open the app. The app keeps loading for 5mins+. Cannot do any online transaction within the app.
Dear admin, please fix your bugs in this app ASAP. The latest update makes everything worse. I can't even open the app, and I can't even transfer online banking at all. If the app isn't gonna get fixed, it's hard for the users to proceed online transaction. I've tried uninstalled the app and reinstall it back but still the same. So pls fix the bug as soon as possible.
Please improve your service bank islam. This apps should be usefull for everyone cause nowadays everything can be manage by using phone. You're one of the best bank i think that i have use but your apps oh god please improve this! Do something!
Alhamdulillah... GO by Bank Islam has gotten better since its downside recently and provided an improved online app banking experience for its users. It is functioning better than ever. Thank you very much Bank Islam!
I cannot even log in at all. I only have this bank and turns out its the worst. Someone needs to fix this app. The app said the IAC is sending me verification code but i didnt receive anything??? Whenever i wanna do online transaction and it asked me to confirm through GO as the final step, I CANNOT GET THROUGH. ITS SO FRUSTRATING. GETTING ON MY NERVES.
Bad experience, and looks like no improvement even though customers rate low. I think you should test your apps thoroughly. It is still the same even you have upgraded the version. Please be serious on improving your customer experience.
The apps is not workable, lagging and not able to log in all the times, resulting in broken dateline and promises( so not islamic at all). Pls pls do something or do we need to report to PMX as well. It has improved and i m satisfied now
The latest mandatory update is full of bugs. I can't open it well especially when I need to transfer my money. The previous version is way better.
After updating still no improvement. After one transaction succsess, next transaction always failed. Always need to log out and delete cache, then can do the transaction. Becoming worst every year.
The worst experience ever in all history of Online Banking app. This app is super slow considering how every user's bank account need verification from this app and yet it took forever to load. Such disappointment
I am using this app since last 3 years. This is so frustrating. The App doesn’t work when you need it the most. I think the developers of this App are too lazy to fix the issues. Going to switch to another bank this week. Bye bye Bank Islam.
Please make an improvement to your apps, I'm very frustrated and annoyed each time to make any payments because this apps keep take a long time on loading page before going to login page. Please Bank Islam, do better.
Can't login, at first didn't approved access, then as it is compulsory, allowed the access, but get error "Unable to connect to the server" Off, clear cached, still can't get through
The previous version is much better than now. I can't even log in to do my transaction and there's always error that I getting annoyed now 😑. Please fix it quickly
The app almost always show error, saying gobank experiencing high volume traffic. Very hard to do online transaction which will need to use go secure.
One of the worst app that I ever downloaded. I used to pay via fpx online but after the new update, I need to get permission from this Go app and sometimes it doesn't even work and after the latest update I can't pay to purchase something online💆‍♂️
i can't log in Go By Bank Islam (it said Invalid Credential) eventhough i updated to the latest version and my device is not old version, i told to the email (contact centre) and no response at all, please fix it ASAP, i need to use the app
Cannot access Tabung Haji even with latest update. App condition somehow as if it's an app made by a guy who just build their first app. It's bank app so with current performance, it's a disappointment.
Just recently update the app, and now i can't even open it😑 it says can't connect to server. Edited: thank you Bank Islam. I follow ur instruction. I delete my app and install it again. It worked
Very inconvenient. Unstable and non worked app. Cant even open the app and just keep loading. I want to give negative star for this useless thing. Rework this disappointing thing.
for many times, i try and try but still cannot login and of course it happens during the most urgent period. worthless apps!
Worst mobile apps ever. It didn't work properly and not even able to open it most of the time especially for Android user.
Unusable. App will stay on the loading page endlessly. Its been going on for months! Update 02/10/2023: Latest updates makes it even worse. Did you guys hire a bunch monkeys to manage this app? Didn't gave them enough bananas?
Told me to use the app instead of website. But the app cannot even open. So how can I transfer and stuff. So disappointed especially during emergency...
Please I'm begging you please update and fix the system..its been down with server error for weeks and this is not the 1st time. Sometimes it takes hours just to load -whattt??
apsal app ni slow sgt.. Bi kena lebih improve customer service n satisfaction ni.. 4 app yg lain semua jauh lbh lancar. Once account freezed, and it keep repeating wrong password.. and u have to wait for 12 hours to make a transaction, this is nonsense service.. I'll better move to other banks..
Slow and annoying...try to open the apps but it keeps on loading till hours, thus delay the validation process of a payment or transaction.
Why does it keep buffering? I'm unable to make any purchases. Help please Latest: I've already updated it. Still the same, is it need a very good internet connection?
Developer's please improve more on your apps . Always being freak all the time . Waiting too long to log in . Please la find a better or more high intelligence IT artist for your apps like the other bank . Not make user easy but burden them .
Hi there, what has happened to this app, I can't log in even i tried many time. Previous version has better version than this new version. Please improve this kind of problem.
Previous update was better than current. Dont know if there any maintenance, app and web both take more time loading and lag when enter it. Please make good your system
Very bad, slow and the apps doesn't even open. Dah la urgent nak bayar student fee, apps pulak lambat tak boleh buka. Even dh uninstall and reinstall balik apps pun still tak boleh buka juga. Please fix the apps
The app some time not available as before . The loading process take a several times. Some time i got fed up with this app. Please make it smooth like your take it money from us.
The system experiences delays until it times out, in Islam is sinful to kill people , this app leads people die fast due to stressful using the app. Therefore, it's essential to invest more in bandwidth. Additionally, there was a security flaw in Duitnow that allowed a hacker to empty my account yesterday
Worst app ever. Does not even start. And it's supposed to be an authticator!???? Please fix this. I cannot do important transactions because of this!!
After the update, now the application can be open smoothly without any stuttering or loading problem. Thank you developer!
Getting worst, cannot open. Please fix it asap. Cannot transfer or doing anything online. Bodoh punya apps. Still same problem after update. Stupid. Ur apps terrible
One of the worst app ever. Why? Because you cant even open the app. They dont give you TAC number anymore to your mobile. You need to approve it from the app when you want to make the transaction. But how do i approve it if i CANT EVEN OPEN THE APP??? The worst app ever!!
WORST APP EVER. Taking forever to load. If you still want to use 'ISLAM' as a brand, kindly improve the app to be more efficient and reliable. It is very embarrassing to see 'ISLAM' attached to a poor, terrible, and pathetic app.
So many issues with the apps. Need to install and uninstall so many times. Least favourite banking app.
4 Oct 2023: Everything goes smoothly for now. Still can improve the UI. Thank you to everyone involved. Up to 4 ⭐
It takes yearsss to load. I need to approve a transaction and it takes forever to open the apps. Please do something about this.
Technology is getting more sophisticated. But this application is still outdated. Please.. Make the maybank2u example always up to date
the system always slow went i want to used it to pay anything with qr and it keep say no connection but my line or connection are in good condition.
It took too long to log in after latest update😠😠😠 After update to latest version,still it takes too long to log in even my phone is already operating in version 13
just shut down the app if you guys can't handle it 🤷🏻 buat app simple simple sudahlah Fix your stupid app, the app always buffers when entering ALL THE TIME I HAVE TO WASTE MY TIME WAITING FOR THIS APP TO OPEN
After update new version, cannot log in..loading too long..waste my time to do any transactions..so disappointed. Please fix this problems.
Got an update, cant log in,.. reinstalling and after all registering it ask me to wait 12 hour, and when i do i still cant load the log in screen.. The biggest dissapoitment ever.
Please fix and do something. I don't know what happened here. Every time I use this app, it shows the 'server error' on the screen 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
So technically cannot use anymore is it? I need to pay my college fee, and it requires confirmation from this app. How do i even do that, this app hasn't worked for almost a year
Almost every time need to delete the app and relogin to access to the app. Pls fix the login problem.
Such a stressful life using this app. Always problem to log in, very slow server, and even I had uninstall and re-install this app almost 10 times. Sometime this app recommend to use internet banking if this app was in high traffic, but same thing happened. Is hard for me almost all the times whenever I want to pay for ptptn, bill, online payment just because of this app. Overall, this app very not helpful at all. Is makes me stress out even more.
Seriously this apps is too slow!! I can't perform a simple money transaction due to the apps just loading itself and I waited for a whole 30 minutes just for the apps to open!!! Even tho it's like that it seems like there's no improvement from the developer to upgrade their application performance... seriously a horrible experience for a cashless person like me.
Very bad application. server always down. Error communication with server. Lag too long. Application did not have user-friendly. Any update did not change anything but make it worse. For technical issue, always be late and too long for maintenance. Suggestion: please improve your server, make staff trained very well for apps, do some testing apps before release it. If apps always crash, make sure ask opinions from another.
Srsly, this system must be improved. I am thinking bout changing my service bcs of this. A simple transaction bcome complicated as h*ll. Byk sgt maintanance. Yeah, a system should be frequently maintaned but the frequency of this app being maintance is just too much and sometimes so abrupt .it bother the urgent transaction. Not only that,the application has tons of problem. Slow.
The worst online banking app. It took so long to just open the app. It will just keep on loading I need to wait for a very long time for the app to literally open for me to do my payment. I need to open the app super early if I want to use the app. There's no nice experience for me while using this app. I really hope that your technology/it team could rework or do something to make the app run smoothly. People has been talking about this problem since forever and I can't see any improvements.
If the App fails, at least makes it relinquish hold of the account. Else, one can get stuck not being able to access an account from either web client or mobile, effectively locking one out of his/her own account! Update: Reliability gets worser with every update. Daily transaction limit has mistakenly being changed from the basis of accumulated amount transferred daily to just a single transaction per-day. Might as well just close your account if you rely on mobile banking at this point.
The apps really bad. You want to make every transaction need to be verified by GO. But almost everytime I do a transaction the verification not pop up from GO apps and the GO apps always can't be open due to high volume. It's really really bad!! Please improve your system!
Please upgrade the apps. Loading time to open the apps is unstable. Sometimes it's working fine, sometime it took forever. Making it hard to perform transaction. Especially, when using Go Secure. I am able to receive notification from other apps while the apps loading for Go Secure. I believed it is not my mobile network problem. Please fix the issue. Online banking apps should be seamless as we are practicing cashless transaction for the norm.
This has to be the worst apps for a bank. You cannot even access and the page rotates like drops of blood oozing and oozing. Even using the website, as payment has to be made, when it transfers to the apps, the apps does not respond promptly until you have delayed payment in your waiting list. Unfortunately, has to be cancelled and switch to another bank service. This has to be the worst nightmare for Bank Islam customers. I would rate this apps zero star for incompetence, slow & irresponsive.
Deserves no star. Time is of the essence when it comes to financial transactions, but with this app constantly crashing, it defeats the whole purpose of having an app for financial transaction. Don't introduce an app if it cannot serve it's purpose. What is the point of me having to approve online banking transaction on the go app if the go pp constantly crashes??? No transaction can go through? Just stick to the code being sent to your phone???
Dear admin, please fix your bugs in this app ASAP. The latest update makes everything worse. I can't even open the app, and I can't even transfer online banking at all. If the app isn't gonna get fixed, it's hard for the users to proceed online transaction. I've tried uninstalled the app and reinstall it back but still the same. So pls fix the bug as soon as possible.
Very annoying. It take a longer time to open the apps. After waiting for so long, the server down and unable to access it . Unhelpful and terrible services . Looks like i may have to uninstall it and change to another bank.
This current version apps are very bad than previous. After I updated to new apps, i having a lot problem to login to do transactions. Its take more times to open because it loading too long. Not so friendly like before. Please do something about that, otherwise you will lose so many customer later. Thank you
29th Jan 2022: GO apps keep loading for quite some time. I've updated my password and even try to reinstall it. But still the issue doesn't resolved. I've been calling customer service/support to identify what's the root cause. Can anyone from IT team able to solve it? 26th June 2023: It getting worse. Seriously it getting worse. Loading time, response time after key in password, transferring money as well (during OTP seems faster), now approving via Apps took a lot of time. Really frustrating
Very frequent system hang. Then I will have to uninstall and reinstall back. Pls improve system reliability and stability. Tq 23 June 2023 Still no improvement with the apps. I still have to uninstall and re install every single time I want to access the Go apps. Worse now it says I can only do transaction 12 hours after! 3rd time already. And you can guess when I try to login after 12 hrs, the apps will just flicker forever and I have to again uninstall and reinstall back. Pls revamp the app.
Actually the app don't deserve ay star at all, I can't even log in despite connected to wifi. The system always lagging and crash, even I'm trying to transfer to my own account. The latest instructions want to encourage the user to use GO apps for any transactions but sadly, the GO apps getting worst without trying.
The app has been working fine for a few weeks but now it suddenly keeps saying to the traffic is high, all the time. And i suddenly have a limit for interbank transfers which doesn't make sense. Just please hire a good team to sort out all these issues.
Worst app ever. Does not even start. And it's supposed to be an authticator!???? Please fix this. I cannot do important transactions because of this!!
It takes yearsss to load. I need to approve a transaction and it takes forever to open the apps. Please do something about this.
Very bad apps.. always crash, hang up, missing favorite acc setting, exceed tx limit error, etc etc 😩👎👎👎...prev version much better...I am frustated during every end of the month when you need to pay a lot of thing..but hopeless... I will terminate my bank account soon (fyi, i am acc holder since 1993)...bye bye
Took forever to launch and it is not user friendly. Admin needs to respond to this matter and find better solutions to improve customers' experiences. An app is supposed to make things easy, not the other way round. Worst service ever. I can't believe that the developer doesn't even bother to address the customers' feedbacks on the app/service performance
Loading more than 1 minute!!! Latest update but nothing changed. Still take a long time to open this app. If I need to do any online transaction😌 then need to get approval from this app, its really not help. I literally spend 2 hours sometimes just to make sure I can make online transaction. High traffic and loading whatsoever are not a joke when the online transfer time only 100+ seconds. Please do improve your apps. It supposedly secure and easy to use. Not just secure and unusefull.
The worst banking app ever. Took forever to login, always buffering. Cannot detect fingerprint and keep on error when logged in by password. Things get harder whenever I want to make urgent transaction. PLEASE do something about all this problems. It is inconvenience in so many ways
worst app ever. it took more than 5 hours to get the receipt of transaction. been loggin in and out. installing and uninstalling. still no improvement. please fix. should deserve no star at all. tired of complaining. same excuses all the time. how much time do you still need to fix this app? it takes forever for you to try to fix this thing is it? and still, no changes ???🤷🏻‍♀️
This app is a mess, cant do anything smoothly. Please improve your server. I cant access it 80% of the time. Even online transfer using computer is a hassle because the final authorization is through the app which you cant access most of the time.
I cannot even log in at all. I only have this bank and turns out its the worst. Someone needs to fix this app. The app said the IAC is sending me verification code but i didnt receive anything??? Whenever i wanna do online transaction and it asked me to confirm through GO as the final step, I CANNOT GET THROUGH. ITS SO FRUSTRATING. GETTING ON MY NERVES.
So technically cannot use anymore is it? I need to pay my college fee, and it requires confirmation from this app. How do i even do that, this app hasn't worked for almost a year
Slow and annoying...try to open the apps but it keeps on loading till hours, thus delay the validation process of a payment or transaction.
I can't use it everytime I try I just server error( unable to connect to the server) But other people can I already reinstall the app update my phone it still not working
Trash apps. If you want to force people to use apps for online payment, make sure it works in the first place. Crash, cannot login, taking ages to try 1 transaction. I hasn't managed to complete a single transaction since being forced to use the apps.
Not a good option if you want to use this apps as your main account. It takes forever to load for login. I have uninstall and reinstall again. Still the same problem. Better to have another account which has more user friendly mobile apps like MAE or CIMB. Today 20/9/23 still same problem. These comments mean nothing perhaps.
I usually use mobile browser to make transfer in Bank Islam. But now you put another filter as in to approve transaction in this GO app. It's good on paper, because another security authentication is always good, BUT THIS GO APP IS ALWAYS UNRESPONSIVE. Imagine a simple transfer takes nearly an hour just to be responsive. Shame on you. It's 2023 but this app likes like it was build in 90s. And NO! I will not reach you at the email given. Step up your game or you'll lose many more users like me.
I recently used the Bank Islam Apps, and it left me thoroughly disappointed. The app's slow performance led to frustrating delays, leaving me waiting embarrassingly outside a restaurant. Adding to the frustration, I was informed that I had to wait a staggering 12 hours before I could make a much-needed money transfer. It was an emergency, and the app failed to provide a timely solution. In desperation, I resorted to using the website, which thankfully worked fine
The system experiences delays until it times out, in Islam is sinful to kill people , this app leads people die fast due to stressful using the app. Therefore, it's essential to invest more in bandwidth. Additionally, there was a security flaw in Duitnow that allowed a hacker to empty my account yesterday
Getting worst, cannot open. Please fix it asap. Cannot transfer or doing anything online. Bodoh punya apps. Still same problem after update. Stupid. Ur apps terrible
After update new version, cannot log in..loading too long..waste my time to do any transactions..so disappointed. Please fix this problems.
I've had quite a frustrating experience with this app. Picture this: you're in the process of confirming a purchase, and you're given just one minute to do so. However, the app takes an eternity to load, and when the time finally runs out, all the items in your cart disappear, forcing you to start the search all over again. It's a situation that leaves me truly disappointed, and I believe Bank Islam should take this feedback seriously. What a shame.
Very slow and unresponsive when selecting several features within the app. Looking forward for improvements in the near future. I expect it to be as good as CIMB clicks app
Mandatory but annoying whenever we need it the most. It lags during online transactions and multiple attempts at reinstalling often leads to confusion. The old ways were pretty much better.
Technology is getting more sophisticated. But this application is still outdated. Please.. Make the maybank2u example always up to date
Such a stressful life using this app. Always problem to log in, very slow server, and even I had uninstall and re-install this app almost 10 times. Sometime this app recommend to use internet banking if this app was in high traffic, but same thing happened. Is hard for me almost all the times whenever I want to pay for ptptn, bill, online payment just because of this app. Overall, this app very not helpful at all. Is makes me stress out even more.
If u want us to update for a better version, make sure that this application is not slow and always loading, I'm tired with this apps, newer but slower version, so what the point of updating if all this things the user need to exprience? Please keep maintaining your apps for better version, fix it asap!
Current version not user friendly. Always have an issue when try to log in and take time to load. The apps keep down whenever we try to open. Please help to fix this. Very difficult for a user to use the apps.
Simple, yet full of features. Unfortunately, not 5-star as it's sometimes difficult to access.
I would give 0.5 star only If I can. This app so worse and complicated to use. It's very sensitive about the security maybe and always got some problem, trouble, issue etc and ask us to go to bank, email the bank or call bank to fix it. Other bank is better because it's easy to use unlike this app. Always give us problem even though we use it politely
The previous version is much better than the latest one. The apps even cannot open anymore. Always lag and not responding. I even can't log in the account. This is upset cause i cant make any online transaction and check the bank account details.
Please fix and do something. I don't know what happened here. Every time I use this app, it shows the 'server error' on the screen 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
Unable to open the app. The app keeps loading for 5mins+. Cannot do any online transaction within the app.
When using scan qr function, there is no dot (.) when you want to make payment. So can't make payment if cents is involved.
If its possible, no star at all. Downloaded the apps because cannot continue with the transaction using the website, then the server keep on "unable to connect to server". U want people to use your apps, like PBe MAE, but then the apps is not working. How come? Many people comment already, no action taken meh? Very poor. Better no apps. Just back to the kampung style. Sigh
WORST APP EVER. Taking forever to load. If you still want to use 'ISLAM' as a brand, kindly improve the app to be more efficient and reliable. It is very embarrassing to see 'ISLAM' attached to a poor, terrible, and pathetic app.
Got an update, cant log in,.. reinstalling and after all registering it ask me to wait 12 hour, and when i do i still cant load the log in screen.. The biggest dissapoitment ever.
please do something bank in should be more easier. I tried to open this application for almost one day. it can be open.. can be impatient. It takes too long to open. Too many time to install unistall. On off the phone.. high traffic it's can't be related. Urgent transaction make a worse experience.
your team have make an improvement to the apps, much better and faster,please make it better. good job.
Edited as 28/11/22 : Only can login after new installation, and the same error still occur on the second,third,4th login you name it. APN_TSN_500 please fix that, or you guys seems working on new app ? Wanna to abandon this one really bad arent you? Edited as 7/8/23 : After a years away, decide to try the app back, now i can say its much better and no pop up error no more. But you are a big name companies, problem like this shouldnt take 1 years to be fixed. Change my ratings to 5 stars
After the update, now the application can be open smoothly without any stuttering or loading problem. Thank you developer!
This app request to update new version to open it but only load for so long and can't even open the app. So bad!!
Really bad comparing to last time. Before upgrading the security, using the TAC is just fine because I can proceed with my PC. But now it requires SecureLogin and then the app is lagging as hell + unable to load. What a waste of time
This is why I hate every single of Malaysia Apps, one of it because, too slow, yeah loading too slow, even sometime the app crash or error. How do you even create this app like a crxp? I want transfer or pay and sometimes the app have a problem, please improve your apps, you want a better rating, improve.. Not just replying and said tq for support and any problem pls report blah blah blah.. No, we don't wanna hear that, we just only want you to improve, that's it
One of the worst app ever. Why? Because you cant even open the app. They dont give you TAC number anymore to your mobile. You need to approve it from the app when you want to make the transaction. But how do i approve it if i CANT EVEN OPEN THE APP??? The worst app ever!!
The old version allowed me to make loan payment even it is joint account unlike this version. Need to make payment via web..so much trouble just to pay my housing loan. This new version also does not allow to take screenshot which I think will be much help to me when I make complaint (as attachment). Useless !
I have poor network condition in my area. When i wanna topup using mydigi. Then for the next step to approve transaction , i need to open apps to approve it. During the approval, the app cannot load due to poor network. After that incident, i cant open the apps because it always popup the approval for transaction then always popup error. What do i have to do to make the apps working properly? I have reinstalling the app but the issue is not yet solved.
Worst app ever. Entered the correct login details yet was blocked. To make it worse I cant even reset my password. It keep looping either at the same page or saying cant connect to server. Seriously, the worst app I have ever used. DO NOT INSTALL!!
It took too long to log in after latest update😠😠😠 After update to latest version,still it takes too long to log in even my phone is already operating in version 13
Dont know what is the problem always exceed limit when i want to make a transfer . Worst apps ever. Better dont have to use app.
Very bad, slow and the apps doesn't even open. Dah la urgent nak bayar student fee, apps pulak lambat tak boleh buka. Even dh uninstall and reinstall balik apps pun still tak boleh buka juga. Please fix the apps
Why it always pop out"can't connect to server" it always happens.it wasn't my connection it all about this app. Please fix em'. So annoying me.
So many issues with the apps. Need to install and uninstall so many times. Least favourite banking app.
Hi. Sorry for the review. Actually it is my mistake. After reading carefully, there are two type of app, 1 is GO, another 1 is GO BIZ. I install the GO BIZ and wondering why I cannot login. Turns out it is actually for business account, which I dont have. Then I install the correct one, which is GO, and I can login now and everything working fine. So I edit back my review and give the app 5 star as I'm very satisfied with the app sp far. Sorry again for the confusion.
just shut down the app if you guys can't handle it 🤷🏻 buat app simple simple sudahlah Fix your stupid app, the app always buffers when entering ALL THE TIME I HAVE TO WASTE MY TIME WAITING FOR THIS APP TO OPEN
Not really work during peak hours. As banking application, it should be able to support higher traffic especially during peak hours. It will be good if IT team can improve the apps ability to handle traffic
ISSUES ALL THE TIME, DELAYED IN OPENING THE APP. which is a huge problem when i wanted to make any transactions in store. Will move to other banks after this. Really bad service. Came back to edit my review, still bad. Much worse. I cant look at my transaction history, have to reload many times. When i say many, more than 10times. So yeah, I don't use the app anymore. I transfer all my salary from bank islam to my other bank straightway after receiving them 😤🤌
As usual this apps are never fail to disappoint me. I want to open it but its just freeze. I cannot log in it. The only successsful thing for this unreliable apps just to frust the users with its uses. Even before log in. The this apps is freeze. So as a compliment i congratulate the developers for developing this incompetent apps for the users.
This app can't working since a few months ago. I have try all methods that have been taught, but the problem is still remain unchanged. I'm using Redmi Note 9s which still Android Version 10. So I hope that this issue will be solve as soon as possible. Thank you.
If you all have issues with unable to connect the server, try uninstall and install it. Hope it helps!
i agree with everyone here. Worst app, slow, and hard to make transaction. stop replying with "we're sorry" and start making improvement. for the meanwhile let us just use the web and TAC instead like before. much easier. you want to make it more secure but the main problem is your apps are getting worst and worst. pleasela fix.
Please improve your service bank islam. This apps should be usefull for everyone cause nowadays everything can be manage by using phone. You're one of the best bank i think that i have use but your apps oh god please improve this! Do something!
Very useless and non-reliable application. Always stuck at the starting page. Have to install and reinstall to make it work, then after some time it will fail again. I don't know who Bank Islam appointed as the developer, including their IT team but they definately non competent and failed big time.
Worse ! Very frustrating! When I need to pay for online shopping, it needs to be authorised on the Go Bank Islam app. When I open the app, it takes a long time to load. After I enter the number and do it, even after the screen shows done, it doesn't pay for the items I need at the online shopping apps. Please improve these. When I deactivate my Go Secure and pay for my online shopping, it still wants to be authorised by the Go Bank Islam app. So, please improve this also. Thank you.
Alhamdulillah... GO by Bank Islam has gotten better since its downside recently and provided an improved online app banking experience for its users. It is functioning better than ever. Thank you very much Bank Islam!
The app keeps on loading in the front page, can't even log in. Very inconvenient. Needs to uninstall and install it back for thousand times cuz it keeps on crashing. Very not recommended when needed to use it in rush.
Why is it taking longer and longer to load the apps??? 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ Developer of this apps should fix it. It's inconvenient. Everytime I want to pay QR, I have to wait for hours. Most of the times I have to say sorry to the cashier and I have to waste my car's oil to go to the bank!!! What's the use of online banking if it is unusable???!!!!
Forever causing difficulties when needed. Forever high traffic, forever cannot procees, forever cannot read finger print & forever making me like a fool when need to pay or transfer at counters or shops. When call for report, the only answer u guys can give is still in the process of developing to give better experience. Nowadays, never have i ever had the experience of logging in only once to just to complete an easy task such as checking my balance. Must at least 3-6 tries before successfull
I am getting error unable to connect to server since the latest update. Such issue shouldn't happened for a banking app.
first time using this application, it went smoothly but the next log in, this app asks me to register again, but when I want to register, this app always can't perform, the answer is always given,"400 bad request","unable to connect the server"," high traffic","server error"...this app does not cooperate and cannot be used because it always asks to be registered...this app is not work ￼
Hi, please make the app very convenient because it really not helpful at all. To transfer or make a transaction, the loading are to long like there are no connection. The website version more convenient & fast than this app, even you successful to log in doesn't mean you transaction will make it on time. Don't link the web transaction confirmation to the app right now. Please bank islam I've being your customer since in college & now I'm 30 don't make it useless make it smooth & fast
The app is slow because it needs a strong Internet connection. That's all. Suggestion: 1. Update the UI app to more fresh one following the trend right now (Be U can, why the official app cannot right?) 2. Make a more friendly user UI, not old school one, bold & not interesting UI.
I don't understand why the app is getting worse after each updates. Online transaction can only be done/approve after approving it via app but app keeps on crashing and it said 'need to reinitiate new transaction'. When new transaction was initiate,the same thing occur again. Then it said new transaction can only be done after 12 hours. Kindly improve the app and fixed the bugs as I never encounter this issues with other bank's app.
Please make this app going faster and smoothly. It took me 10 minutes just for entering. Sometimes server busy and not responding ☺️. It is better using official website then the app. Feel too much irritated due to loading. Even after loading some of the transaction is late updated. And sometimes the available balance and current balance is not merge amount making me confused.
the system always slow went i want to used it to pay anything with qr and it keep say no connection but my line or connection are in good condition.
you gotta be kidding me- i've been using bank islam for a while now and tell me, why is there server error keeps happening every time despite i was having a really good internet connection, especially if i want to make IMPORTANT transaction????? i wish i can give zero stars for this app because it gets progressively worse over time and i see no improvements AT ALL for the past few years since i opened the account
Why the apps always out of server? It's kinda annoying when it happen! It's prevent from doing transaction! I hope you can fix it as soon as possible. It's always the connection problem. Why? Hope this will be fix!!!
Apps stuck hang! App still having the same problem. Loading to long, tried uninstall and installed back still facing the same problem year ago today still facing the same problem. What does this company do for improvement actually. Other banks already making it easier for customers but this company still no changes. Shame carrying up big name for bank name.
Very frustrating. Update, uninstall, reinstall, clear cache a few times still not working. Shud change to other bank now
Literally one of the worst banking app to ever exist. Don't even bother downloading. I'm on the latest update and the app seems to be stuck on that annoying "loading" screen whilst I'm on an important affair. It's 2023 and the app still has major performance issue. Not to mention the horrible UI design. Bank Islam needs to fire whoever is in-charge on maintaining this app.
SO SLOW THAT I CANNOT GET ANY PAYMENT DONE WITHIN TIME LIMIT. since they don't give TAC anymore, i have to approve payment through the go app but it takes forever to load the screen. one time i got a 20 minutes time limit to finish a payment. the whole 20 minutes. THE WHOLE 20 MINUTES. THE SCREEN WAS STILL LOADING. PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS IT MAY HAVE DISRUPTED SO MANY OF YOUR USERS' BUSINESS.
The most useless apps in the phone.not a friendly user apps since it's take too much time to open it (always shows high traffic volume while the user's internet connection are good..better upgrade your apps as soon as possible.
What the hell with your apps, it's getting worse day by day, i don't know what type of system that u've been used, it's seem so bad and always not function., Do something with your system, take a look and try at least to improve your system, i thought with apps more easy, but end up it's make me more miserable then before, you guys have to do something about that, try follow like maybank2u, more easy and friendly user..
STUPID APP!!!!!!! everytime server error, loading take a very long time. how to make online transactions if you cannot even go into the first page. it should be name as NO/CANNOT GO APP instead..better changing to other bank.
Please do something with this app. Transection cannot go smoothly. How many time have to uninstall and install back.
Please fix the loading issues on this app, I am restarting this app for 10 times and I still couldn't get through.
Frustrated. Almost every time i want to use the system always down. Please improve it.
Can I know why I use Celcom data(I don't test others brand data) cannot use Go Bank Islam? When I try using wifi, the app smoothly open which have no needed pending a very long time. I try watch yt on 1080p using a data, the speed is okey no slow. Please fix this horrible situation because I was on the hurry to use Go BI but can't open it. If something emergency I cannot rely much on this Go Bi. Other than that, please make bank islam look more user-friendly because it's hard to use.
Almost every time need to delete the app and relogin to access to the app. Pls fix the login problem.
I want to open the app, it takes a long time to load..then I want to transfer money, it loads again..then it is denied.. after that i must to delete the app, then download it again.. open the app, it loads again, then it is denied and I have to wait 12 hours to make the transfer.. the same thing happens over and over again.. please do something & improve your services..
Please USE MAYBANK M2U programmer to make this app better. Really hard to open, even to check my balance. When i want to make transfer, app showing error, but money already transferred. Very frustrated. This is about security & people money. Please making big change for ur banking system. Dont just keeps updating without any different. 0 star to u guys
The new online transaction where it requires this "very well made app" is such a great idea from them as I would need to face the buffering, 200 seconds when there's problem with the app, error 500, reinitiate the transaction and much more :). I had such a blast using this app!!!!:)))))))
Worst app ever. It is supposed to make things easier, but this app makes things harder. Always took a very longggggg time to launch, always high volume of traffic. Wasting so much time waiting this app to launch to make a single transaction.
It says wrong server, wrong connection then I uninstall & install the app again it become worse.. App keep loading.. Please do something..
Please fix this app ASAP, i've been uninstalling and installing this app countless time, everytime wanna use it, I can't even open it. It just keep on loading and doesn't let me ues it. Not only me, some of my friends and family face the same problem.
The most ridiculous bank app I've ever had to use. The thing just keeps loading for eternity on the welcome page! I can't even do online banking with my Bank Islam account because of this! WTH
TAKES TOO LONG TO LOAD. Please take action and fix this app. Making it difficult for users to pay and check the balance. It seems that not once or two users sound about this problem,but your party still does not make reforms and improve the problems faced by all of us.
THE WORST BANKING APPS EVER. This apps doesnt deserve any star at all. Very slow response. This problem has been addressed for so many times but it seems like there are no initiatives at all from the developers. If you dont want to improve your apps then dont bother create one. Will definitely switch to another bank
Need to get started after update. But after key in IAC number, it's loading until forever. Do it 3times but still same, even already received sms said done register go apps. Buying new phone to make sure using latest android version. Still same. Usually open in website. But right now want to have approval in go-secure. So, cannot do any transactions.
What is wrong with this app?! Its getting worse than the older version this is so time consuming. It keeps loading way longer than expected. I cant do my online transaction if this keep going on. Do something about this IT management or whoever in charge for this apps. Because this app is so disappointing.
Before the latest update i like this apps , smooth but after the update can't open the apps ' LOADINGGGGGGGGGGGGGĜGGGGGGGGGGG......plis fix this prob ASAP....TQ THE WORST BANK APPS SYSTEM I'VE EVER SEEN COMPARE TO OTHERS BANK APPS....
This app sucks, before this doesn't have any issue. Now after new updates i can't use it like before. The apps always crash, cannot log in, and now when doing transaction we need to use go secure and it need the apps to works in order to proceed but now the apps it self cannot open, then how i going to proceed with the payment?
Please disable the function which require customers to use this app for making transaction online, it cannot be use at all, especially when there is urgent need to transfer money. People may die somewhere because of this useless apps! I will consider to terminate my bank account if the issue still continue.
Very slow, difficult to open, please upgrade your service like other banks. Now I cant log in due to unable server🤬
App is so slow. Always have problem / Time Out while waiting for GoSecure to authorize fund transfer..
Bad. Everytime also cannot open. Always high volume. I need to uninstall and reinstall. Still cannot open. Lame. Now fully need to use gosecure what so ever, but to open, the apps still loading.
Previous is much better than new version or even worst.I could not do transfer after skip one time and pop up said it can be done after 12hr ??? What??? Bank islam please dont do this , you should be better with growing IT...
I think this is the 10th million times I had to uninstall and reinstall. Almost a year has passed and this still could not be resolved? It was such a nuisance when u have to do an urgent transfer but the gosecure couldn't be accessed as it took forever to load the page!!! Apa ni bank islam? Benda basic masih lagi sangkut?
worst app ever. so slow. always loading. it deserve 0 star. this problem has been happening or so long, was wondering if you ever want to improve this app?
Honestly I have no idea why I even bother still having the app, it is an effort in futility with how slow and the incomprehensible waiting time for it to open. It just like their management just want to be cursed by their users.
Very disappointed with the app. I don't know why I thought having all my money in this account would be useful. I've been trying to order my food online, and I couldn't do it as this app is not even turning on. I can't transfer in even from browsers. Haritu rasa macam dah okay sikit masalah ni, tetiba jadi balik. Tolonglaa be responsible with the app. It freaking holds our money, how should I believe this app if nak log in pon dah macam2 problem. Very embarrassing.
getting worse after the update. even a standard online banking would FORCE its user to open GoApp to authorise EVERY EFING transaction. This certainly causes unnecessary problem since I am the one who manage my family bank acc just from online transaction, totally away from home as a student. It it much easier before, but now, cannot anymore.
The app is worst! Only few times I can use my online banking without any problem, most of the time the server just doesn't seem to work. Nonsense! Please do something about this or else, do not have any apps at all.
I have updated the apps, but it is getting worse. I want to transfer to shopee, but fpx Bank Islam can't be used. Shopee history already stated as cancelled, but in the Bank Islam apps, the transfer is still reinitiated. After that, I can't open the apps because I keep mentioning "reinitiated transfer". Even after uninstall and install again, it still the same and can't be used.
this is the worst online banking app ever. It is always unusable. always under repair & log in takes a long time. I don't know what the problem is. every time I want to use it, I have to uninstall and reinstall it. please fix it. I can't stand it anymore.
It is good enough now. But still sometimes it will be stuck on the loading screen. Hope it can be better soon.
EDITED 25/6/23 : i thought it was getting better. Sadly, the smooth experience only last for 1 week. Now the apps is getting worst and slower than last time. Im planning on changing banking apps. 3 years and still no improvement. Please change your dev team / invest more on user exp.
Really bad experience. Too many times unresponsive, taking a lot of time loading and just now i can't even pay my bills because it has to be approved by unresponsive apps! You need to learn from Maybank or even MBSB, their apps are much better.
It don't work for open the apps n transaction. Please repair your apps!!! Why not allow to click apps this, aq geramm til lah baiki boleh tak?!
Good job, the application is better day by day. Keep improving, hope it'll be as good as it could be.
Already updated,but still have problem. cannot make a payment or transaction by using other apps
Selepas updated makin teruk loading dan over slow. Kenapa system apps bank islam menyusahkan pengguna? New prob APZ_TSN_500 unable to process your request. Still same when to open apps.
This app has been abysmally slow for the past months. It always fail to load past the circling loading animation. Not to mention my uni where i study use bank islam as main channel for financial services. But fortunately my uni has change to new RHB Bank. Please devs, fix your app ASAP. Update to dev : cache clear didnt help. I almost lose money when buying bus ticket using online banking bank islam. I was forced to use the app's Go Secure function yet the app fail to load past circle animation.
Previous version apps are more batter than current apps. After I updated to a new apps the apps seems having a bad issues. 1. It is hard to open, and it takes more time to open. Loading too long. 2. Even though1 managed to log in, when I choose, as an example, to transfer a money, the apps will be loaded again, and it takes a long time to load. 3. Not so friendly like before, because when I would like to check other things inside the apps, the same issue happens. Please make changes
It's faster than other bank's app that I've used. For now. BUT... I can't share the receipt nor can I screenshot them. When I clicked the share button, it's loading forever. It's troublesome.
It doesnt work lately. Infinite load screen, terrible lag. Its a shame becuz i really like the interface. Please keep performance in mind. Your web app works flawlessly, why the mobile app so bad?
The authorization thru the Go apps is really annoying, I only want to spend like rm20 thru fpx but I still need to authorize my transaction using the apps. I understand it will increase the security . But if the apps keep loading forever how can I even buy things online. I need to buy some food for my CAT!! AND THE APP KEEP LOADING FOREVER...MY CAT ARE DYING. WHY ARE YOU MAKING THIS HARDER FOR US 😭😭😭
This app keep getting worse every time I update. The "loading" getting longer whether still log in page or when I want to transfer. PLEASE FIX THIS. Supposedly when it updated, it getting better not otherwise.
I try to reinstall the app because its still in the loop mode for a long time. But after reinstall Ive to wait 12 hour to do duit now transfer. Instead trying to make it easier for us to do online transaction, it make we are keep waiting and harder to do online transaction. Such a nuisance!
Terrible app. Even ady update to version 3.2.10, even ady reinstall many times still cannot use the app.
The new update is really bad. If You want to transfer money, the app needed you to reconfirm in GO app, GO app took forever to load, in the meantime you have 180 seconds to confirm transaction through GO app thats still fail to load. I am really Disappointed. The worst experience ever.
Several problem occurred after recent update. Can't pay anything that need approval from apps and can't open the qr code
Slow connection. Unstable apps. Please improve for better performance. We are going for digital platform so need a better performance and easier for use.
Can not log in in the phone app. Keep loading. Very disappointed!!!!!!!
Poor services. Can't access apps due to high traffic, so need to use browser instead for transactions. Better use browsing rather than download this apps. Kindly test run the apps stability then only launch it.
I can't connect with this app. That's weird after updated. And always wanted update. Weirdo

very bad after update..everytime and everyday when i'm want to log in... still cannot log in and still everytime traffic issues..it's make me stress.. i like to throw my phone in the river everytime i log in this apps.... very2 stress... every time and everyday its very2 hard to log in... when it's really impportant to use.. but still cannot log in.. very bad apps right now. . after reinstall.. it's still cannot log in.. every minute traffic issue...its not good to use right now.. i hate this..
used to make online transfer from website but now it needs to get approve using the app but the apps is sooo slow. this is why I prefer using website rather than the apps. please fix it, I've been waiting for days and still to transfer my money from bank islam to another bank. don't make people's life hard, it's not good. so many complaints but nothing change.
Issues all the time, you will either face "unable to connect to server" or "high traffic" notice. Even though I have updated to the latest version and even reinstall the apps a few times, there's still no improvement whatsoever. Nonsensical. Update: if the app is only problematic for me, I may understand that I need to clear the cache or change to mobile data. But, when all the user are facing the same problem, it just shows that you have failed to provide a bare minimum for this app.

App becoming worst after the last update rolled out. Seriously slow, lagging, take long time for loading more than a minute, need to clear cache many times just to approve a transaction or get to login interface, and forever loading. Honest talk here, please do improve the apps. thank you
Very bad Apps. After updated, long long time for the loading. Please improve you Apps
Too bad.. took a veeerrrryyyy long time to access lots of hang, hard to trsfr. Bad apps.. need to improve more
Very unreliable apps , very hard to do transaction , i had to transfer all my money to other banks for better transaction procesess
the worst app ever. if your system cannot support the go secure feature, then better delete it. Just use the old tac method. Really wasting my time using this app. Need to go forth between this app and merchant app many time because the transaction cannot pass thru after the go secure step
It took so long to just open the app, keep loading, then after key in the password, need to wait again. Imagine if I use online banking payment, got long que in market, sure I'll get yell from other customers behind me. This is so slow. Bad experience. Needs to improve or I need to open new account bank and choose another bank instead (of course not Bank Islam no more)
I'm just give a single star because the process is too slow. And my money getting lost by itself without I use it. I'm not rich to sacrifice my single cents
Why keep saying to clear cache. How many times clear (lost counted) it still lagging and there's so many comments with same problem . Slow , lagging ,system down & bla.. bla..bla. Don't just respond to customers to convince them only, pls also solve the problem and find solution . Previously this apps not that worst .
can't open after updated the app,updated to the latest version (3 October 2023) still cannot open,android 12
Very slow for every loading pages, I wait for 5 minutes also nothing happen, please take this seriouly.
We know u trying your best to keep our fund save, but please if u guys always hold and updating the app for unreasonably period of time during peak weekends. It's no absolutely contengency plan from your side on how we need to dug our money for payment... Duhh... Maybe all BIMB branch is super high volume right now withdraw thier money manual for each payment.. if u guys not an expert in apps try hired some expert to do it right! It just took obvious.. too obvious... Same things always happen..
Response is slow as hell. While waiting for the loadings that appear everywhere in the app, I drove to Bank Islam (which is 30 minutes from my home) and performed the transaction. When I got home, it was still loading. Bravo to the developer.
Took lots time to make transaction. Sometimes failed to do it. Just loading...
"02-0005 INVALID CREDENTIAL"....I was locked out of my own account because the app always saying my credential is invalid even though it was fine when logged in via web. 🤬 Installed because the website forces to approve transaction via app, but the app says invalid credential. There should be a 'no' option because I hate the app. This app has major issue. 👎 Developer responds the same way as other critics in the review as if it was a bot replying. Google please take action and remove this app.
Worst ever apps. Lagging, loading, unable to ever enter the first page like 24/7. Apps should make life easier, but this is exactly the opposite way. Thanks to this apps, ill will never use Bank Islam again. Time to change to another stable bank.
Latest app version is super slow. Start to wonder if this app hasn't perform any performance test for the latest build. So frustrated. Cant perform txn coz stuck at splash screen when app launch.
Just please bring back the TAC no and no need GO secure for online transactions. It's suck when everything about the transaction need to go through the apps but the apps are so useless n loading. Why do you all doesn't have any backup plan for your customers? It's so annoying!
I think the previous App was better than now. Not only you cannot access the mobile app page, but when you want to make transfer of money, you need to access/get approval from the mobile app which cannot be accessed. How stupid it is....
Please do something, not reliable. Always facing 'non stop loading' when I want to tap for secure tac when transferring money
Very bad apps,very slow, couldnt ss.. too much time taken to be approved, managed.. hopefully you'll improve your system
pleasee repare the app . soo sloww . sometimes when im urgent wanted to transfer it takes so long to login
Cannot launching, sometimes meed to be wait. And the worst moment is when i need to make a transaction on web, they ask to approve by via app and the app cannot be open. So why do we need thiss app meanwhile it cannot be launching??? Please do something. It almost 3 years ive been used this and it still same like BEFORE
The worst bank I dealt with in my life: It doesn't work with my pixel 6, I can't even use my account on the website because ask me give approval on their app and app does not work.. what stupid poor service they doing, the email doesn't work also!! Plus many more other bad things....
Very Terrible. There's always something wrong with the server and traffic. Make it almost impossible for me to make any payment/money transfer. Annoying and took alot of time to recover. Sometimes, can't event get into the home page. Already uninstall and install the newest version but it become worst than i expected. Please make an improvement abt the app.
Very buggy and now i am unable to log in to my account due to it always stuck at the startup stating, "unable to connect to the server". While, some of my friends are able to use it like normal, but the other friends faced the same thing as me. Very slow in repairing it's bug and problem. Overall, it's disappointing to be honest.
After update the latest version, the apps seem having a lot of trouble..unable to do transaction smoothly.. cannot transfer money and taking more time loading and lastly it will logout suddently
I cannot login to approve my transactions from the web!!! Please fix the app!!! No more SMS TAC so your app is VERY important to function, login also not functioning!!! Update: Help was provided after contact and resolved my issue, bumped the rating stars for this
Please revert back the system to the old one. This new GO is a NO-GO. Not a user friendly at all. The apps keeps crashing and I cannot even log in to system properly.
Everytime update mesti bermasalah! Worst app ever!! Unfriendly, hassle and very irritating!! Transaction were all failed... menyusahkan hidup i! its been 3 days and in consecutive of everytime you all update the system!! What are you guys doing?! Takde usaha nak perbaiki masalah ni ke?! Shows your system and management terrible and weak!
Why this apps always problem? Either with wifi or data. Either bug or loading too long time, taking a very long time to open the apps, and many time 'under maintainence'. Already use this apps for more than 3 years. Please go for some improvements for this apps
2 days i cant log in. They say (unable to connect to server. Please fix this. Edit. ( now tabung haji cant open also).
Why this apps on 23rd until 10th every month can be used smoothly, always crash and need to reinstall back and set up all over again.. i have a bills to pay and i thought online banking are really helpfull my time.. but not on BIMB platform.. please fix this, i been using since 2018 until now same problem coming
Bank Islam app dosen't work at all. Everytime log in, it will take forever to load. The only way is to uninstall and re-install the app. Very inconvenient. In this age of online banking bank islam dont seem to be able to solve simple problem like this. Other banks have no issue on their apps. Very basic problems yet Bank Islam can't solve it. Dosent reflect the islamic or the banking status it deserve. Bank Islam customers are mostly B40 based that explains their typical "tidak apa" attitude.
What the function adding qr code scan system if opening the app take like whole hours to open and what the point to even exist if optimise too slow. Where the fund for the project to utilise and bring comfort and better and easy way if it keep failing us the customer. fixed you for sake of god app!
Unable to open at all most of the time, when u need to access account urgently, not a convinience place to save here
Getting worse. I'm using android ver 13. My internet line is 80-140 Mbps. I just bought new handphone. This is a global problem and not an isolated case. So why need any user that complain to contact the mobileapp when improvement has to be made at higher level. Don't be cheapskate and refused to invest for a better app developer
I can't do any transaction as they need an approval through the app..yet i can't even open the app. This is really frustrating. You should be aware that you've been receiving bad reviews the most. Hope you can fix this matter very soon!
I HATE THIS APPS SO MUCH!! I need to uninstall this apps for getting the secure LOL. Again and again. I am tried! PLEASE FIX IT! Learn from BSNsecure PLEASEE!!
Very bad experience. Try to pay for my korban since last night, even tried at 1am. but after filling up details, go bimb took very long time to show relevant screen then says no instruction for payment. Tried several times. Same experience until now. Who will bear cost - spiritual cost if i still cannot pay through bimb? Previous version much3 better.
Typical server problem. Always high volume of traffic. Fix this problem asap. There's lots of people using this app, and still no action taken. Please, fix this problem. Guna app, berpusing. Guna web, pun ikut pusing. Fix asap, or you'll lose customers/users faster than you realize.
I can use the app only once and then it crashed everytime i want to use the app.
The apps is very no responsive. When we urgently need to transfer fund, we cannot access the apps, when we use web browser ,the approval must via GO. How i want to access my money when i can access the apps??? Really disappointed. This never ending story.
The app refuse to open — even after I waited for long. I can't even see the login screen, merely those pink loading blob that irritated me. I'm not one to leave a bad review, but this is getting ridiculous. Judging by others reviews, I'm not the only one. Please fix this, it's hard for me to do stuff when I can't even access my own money.
Now we can't use website to transfer? It's asking me to go app but the app itself not working properly. Showing errors always, waited for so long but still showing like that. Thought it needs update, but no update available. Regret downloading it.
Can't login after receiving no from no phone it say bad request I already update this app but still same problems already update sign in put REQ registered but can't login
Very inconvenient. Couldnt login in the app and it said to use the web version. But when I tried to do a transfer, it said to use the app to approve the payment. I wish there's an easier way to use Bank Islam.
Shittiest bank app in Malaysia. Cannot even open because it is so slow. Ugliest interface too.
very awful apps...lagging and lagging and lagging. I really wonder whether any QC or improvement done for this apps. totally frustrated use. The share button hardly any use whenever we want to share proof of transaction. please do some job!
Everytime I need to use online transactions this apps keep on alert server not available. So then I need to uninstall and then install again. Why this keep happening. Can you create a better functional apps to ease the customer.
I had operating system above 9, but why the app did not function. Everytime I open the app, it stated unable to connect to the server. There so many things I need to pay through this app. Please help me.
This is my first time using this app and it it the worst. I already had problems using it and now i facing the connection problem i have a stable connection but the app said it is untrusted connection. What does it mean?? Please fix it immediately
The worst online banking apps..Not convinience to use because always stuck at front page or loading time took longer whenever want to check balance or make transanction using this apps. Kindly upgrade it..
cant do internal transfer for my investment account and savings account anymore, it says exceed limit. there was no problem before, please fix this, already updated the limit,but still the same
Why when using online banking from web browser quite fast, but thru app can't connect to the login? Using different server or the app's connectivity very bad? Please fix it as some transaction need to go through Go Bank app.
Suck and hard to get access. When require fast transaction in any store it make it headache. From 2016 until now doesnt have much improvement by BIMB. Really disappointed on failure of management team BIMB.
Worst apps ever... Hard to make a transaction due to lag and endless loading.. i thought banking apps supposed to make my life easier.. but when i need to make a transaction through biz page.. i still need an approval of my transaction through these slow apps.. useless..
I dont even know what happening with this app anymore. i cant even open the apps and used it to pay online. It said server error continuously. Everytime i need to pay online i have to open this app and approve the payment but this app didnt work at all. Let me just use TAC if this app have a problem .this is worst.
Worst apps...always loading...I can't use online transfer just because must validate by this apps... in the end still to use old system go to ATM and transfer via machine
It's always says cannot connect to server. I cannot use this app at all. Please improve your app or i should change my bank soon.
Good and improved on the accessibility. Keep going to serve better.
I got error all the time went to sign in... I need to uninstall and install again.. And it will be the same.. The application take more time then last version...
Can't connect to the server, for days. Good job screwing up the fund to develop the apps, BIMB
App is not working at all. It keeps showing the loading icon. Thanks to not working I am unable to approve transfers when using rhe website instead
Always error, dont create app if always be like this,.. need to open website everytime.. From IOS to Android still facing the same problem. Poor technical system
Apps bugs for many time when i used to pay with qr.. Long queue rear me for paying ahhh lukcily can put atleast 1 star if dont i wont rates even 1 star
Still worse after update on latest version. Lag, didnt show account history, qr pun loading, disarankan bertukar ke bank lain
System very slow during login.. sometime need to re-install the app then can use..
App updated. Unable to access service. Bad app. Response from admin also bad. Bank Islam get this sort out
As i using it,this apps become more stable and smooth than before, keep it up 🤗
New version has better than previous version. Good improvement for Bank Islam. Proceed with tagline 'Assuring Trust. Delivering Value'.
Takes forever to load, very slow, please fix the loading time issue
very baddddd. always cannot open. always server error!
Still bad service...slow maintenance...I can't even do anything through website or application
Apps keep stuck before login page. Your apps and server is made up of a potato or what?
The apps enlighten my routine. Its futuristic and fast.
So inconvenience. Lag almost all the time. Please please please improve this app
I rated 1 star in 2019 (deleted) and i can now attest that Go has made so much improvements. Go, you deserve 5 stars.
Easy to use even for beginner with appropriate button function
The apps is always unable to connect to the server
take so much time just to check my balance, it keeps giving server error😌
Straightforward to use and app has been improving over time!
too bad, always need to update, poor servers .
apps yg sgt tidak membantu,nak log in pon susa,x dpt..buffer..pakai chrome ok je log in..tp x guna gak klau pki chrome nk buat approval kne log in apps gk..benda ni da lama x de improvement pon..please la BIMB learn from others bank apps such as HLB very effsien n convenient..
Very disappointed with the apps, apps keep lagging, hanging. It takes too long even to log in and it just keep crashing. Just do something about it. 1/5 star
Not even worth for 1 star. Please do something about the update. As user, we called contact centre, emailed to mobileadmin.. No useful feedback is given... But for dis time, after update, dont uninstall & reinstall back. U will face cooling off for 12 HOURS. ALL TRANSACTIONS CANNOT DO.. So please, increase your patience or change to other bank...
Unable to connect to server. And still the same even already update the apps :(
Why during Im buying foods you decided to be unavailable its hard yk I need the money seriously can you hurry up I need to use the card seriously I couldn't even pay for the food bc of the maintenance
Very bad poor app for banking..need to upgrade like other banking system..not friendly user..dissapointed
Am having trouble downloading mobile transaction receipt, whereby nothing is downloaded.. its blank if share!!!
I cannot open the app since I downloaded the new version. It kept showing the Unable to Connect to Server box everytime I open the app. I have been using it for 2 years and it got its up and down, but this time is the worst. And since everything needed to be aunthenticate using the Go app, I found it very inconvenient and a huge hassle. Please do something about it. Thank you.
Very lousy apps. I think lot of people already acknowledged the issue so i have nothing more to say
Keep crashing and unable to connect to server
Worst apps i had used, always buffering and can not log in ..who's your IT department pic for server ..should change that person ..
Hire someone can fix this apps asapla. Aiyoo. Big company but loading time never improve.
still loading and cannot open after restart phone,reinstall apps,nothing happen and still same
Too slow to open, missed my transaction. Latest app version.
Seriously..just go back using pin number..using this app to confirm every purchase is nightmare..
Hire some better developers. Super slow app, assuming it's actually loading at all
Not so convenience to use for the waiting time. Need to always update.
Hi admin, why I can't do transfer from TH to own bank Islam acct? Error message keeps on pop up no matter how myluch I tried and after reinstalled few times
the longer it takes to open the app.. the slower it gets...it's always loading why ahh??
the worst, tak pernah dapat bukak. selalu server error. please fix this issue

Always server error, external not responding idk why this apps become so suck after update and update,
Every time to open the apps always be loading until infiniti.. Hurmm
If I can give Half star. I will. Alway keep me waiting too long, Loading and loading.
Apps very slow..please do apps fast..very very very disappointed..
Why when i open this app, an error 500 appears. Please solve this issue as soon as possible
The app getting improvements with user-friendly functions.
I actually wanted to give this app five stars, but after seeing the rating which is 1.3...then I decided to give 1 star...in simple words, I want to set the rating to always be 1...AHAHAHAHAH 🤣🤣 poor "bank islam".
After a new update this week it seems even worst than previous, Cant even open always loading
if u cannot give better service then dont forced us to use ur apps..make many people in trouble..please take note with a lot of comment here n there..n pls do improve it
What kind of app that keep getting slower after update. All they can do is say sorry and after a year waiting for improvement, it keep getting worse with heavy traffic and all. WARNING just delete the app and have better life using other bangking app.
Really bad experience with this apps, always hanging..round and round but not appear. Want to do online, ask to use this apps but always fail..
New apps so sucks.. Make me stress to use it.. Waiting so long and still loading...
Hi there. Just want to highlight an issue where whenever I tried to set up a new favourite account, or adjusting any setting in the apps, out of the blue, there will be a pop up saying "No valid session...". And I will be forced to log out. This occur not only once, but a few time that I got so annoyed and irritated. Kindly take a prompt action to fix this tq
To slow...update for nothing...pls upgrade your system...bodo punya apps....menyusahkan user....slow mau mampus...xpayah update la kalau slow...
Could you separate your ATM locations and branch locations because the branch locator is mixed up with ATM locations. I want to search for a branch.
A good initiative. Had been using it for a while and had decent exp. But I can't put myself to give a better rating when the app keeps on crashing after an update. Never have I ever have to uninstall & reinstall an app per update. & don't get me start with the lag. Even when my data is good, the app failed to load. Please make an effort to repair these bugs. Tiring & malfunctioning as well. On a flip side, it feels safe to use. Won't use anymore unless necessary.
New version is horrible terible, loading is too long and doesn't allow to screenshot. Old version is better. Not statified with the current version.
Took long time to load, please fix for most Android device
Useless app, loading to long. During emergency time need to transfer money suddenly unable to open app. Really hope for improvement. I'm thinking of switching to maybank after this. Good bye Go bank islam.
Bad bad bad .please developed the software with better performance .check the cache .possibility how the data been transfered.take care about time processing and multhreathing.the ui is good but the performance out
Take time for loading. Sometimes it took half an hour. I try to log in using chrome to make online transfer but it still require me to use go secure in the apps. 😮‍💨😮‍💨 Please fix your apps. Thank you
Soooo slow to open the app... the loading took so long... very difficult to check my statement bcs it's always got prob. Very bad app.. always have prob and it took me so long to open app especially when I'm in urgent. Really need to be improve!!!!!
Just so terrible & annoying, this is the worst banking app i ever used, now its latest feature introduced verification through the app when you want to make an online transactions, i can't even login the app..everytime i wanna do a transaction, i need to go to nearest atm..so what's the point of this trash app anyway, so useless..
A really bad app. Cannot login. But i cannot do transaction from internet banking. I need to get the secure code from the app, but the app cannot be opened. Maybank is way much better than this. Its a total failure for me. It should have been 0 star from me.
I download this to experience a much better and faster services, but end up got more lagging, more waiting and in the end cant even function properly... Quite disappointed to be honest.. update:imma change the rating to 5* now since it work well. Thanks for your hardwork~
Slow, very bad.. i need to wait for so long, but most of the time it didnt load at all!! Do something....dont launch an app, if it is not ready .. TAP was much more reliable than GO
In-app purchase authorization (GO-secure) crashed continuously despite good internet connectivity. OTP system usually okay (but lagged in sending the code also at some point) but the latter is way laggy and worse.
I don't know whether the apps is useless or it is useless but its uselees either way. Service not available, glitching, loading.. doing online banking but need to approve transaction on apps and yet the apps crashing.. why there is no improvement made despite bunch of complaints
The worst online banking app in Malaysia, no doubt. For 3 days I cannot make any payment due to high traffic, high volume, error and whatsoever. Just imagine if you only have 1 bank that use online banking. You can't make any transfer, can't pay bill, can't do online purchases. Please upgrade your system. Go find new tender, new company to handle the server. I'm sick of it and I'm on the way to change to another bank.
Totally trash and unreliable apps. It look like the bank hire the intern to develop the apps. Always have issue to start the app especially during online payment. Please improve
Always getting high traffic error when payday. There has been no improvement for the past few months to solve the issue. I cant use the apps on payday.
I can't make any payment. the app keep loading. wasting time. fyi the app is updated. WiFi also excellent. the app is the issue. please bring IAC back.
Worst appplication ever. You are making it compulsory for verification via go by bank islam for each transaction but the apps is not functioning most of the time. This is so annoying and cause lots of problem for the user during transaction.
Very disappointing, please improve your app service, as there's now a mandatory to approve any transaction using the app. If the app keep stuck at the loading screen how on earth we cam complete the transaction
I literally just wanted to buy top up but the website ask me to download this before I can proceed with my purchase, trying to login into the app takes so much time that the timer had already been expired and I can't even get past the Bank Islam logo😠, consider switching to another bank that has a better mobile app experience than this app
Is a very rubbish app. Why already so many people complaining about this app and still don't want solve the problem are you just ignore what the things that people complaining at here? The app keep on cannot log in keep on say error and I want to reload e wallet need to go the app to approve it I cannot make it also want to use online pay also also need the app to approve. What for make people difficult if this keep on happening and we cannot make our things done and no any improvement.
Bank Islam can you improve your app it really slow like turtle then i can't even login to my acc because of it keeps loading, do better and find someone that can fix your app. I have been using this app for 2 years and the problem still the same please fix to make it more better
lagging and slow. if we have to use this apps to make an approval of transaction please keep this apps always in good maintenance and friendly useable. been hours waiting and lagging just to make an approval transaction. or please provide for users to choose either approve using TAC or this ridiculous apps. i just want the best for BANK ISLAM
It is veryyyy slow. Oftentime when i wanna authorize any transaction using go by bank islam, i have to do it 4-5 times because it keeps loading. There are times i couldnt proceed with the authorization at all. Please bank islam. Upgrade your app.
I don't know what's wrong with this app,every time I try to login,it don't allow me to do so..I already put the right password,but still it didn't work out..and always lag,hope so it soon will be fix..
Always problem with the internet connection. No matter how many update. Used to be fine with the website. But now can't do any transaction in it anymore without using the app.
After updated more loading! Use website also need to approve on apps! It has been 2 years this apps got problem and still can't solve it! All are SINECURE! It's so annoying! Worseeeee apps ever! Waste time and slowww!
Difficult to use. Internet banking more convenient before. But still need to approved by GO app and delayed internet banking transaction. Not all people have big phone storage just for all kind of apps.
Whenever I'm opening the app the only thing it says unable to connect to the server. Even though I update the app same problem every time. So irritated.
I have to wait so long before i can make transaction. Please improve. Sometimes, i can't even open this apps if i have some emergency transaction. Please improve this apps. Don't make it worse!. Please.
The worst app you can possibly imagine. Please provide a service that you can deliver, if not just cancel it out. Take a verrryyyyyyyy long time to log in, to scan qr. It just DON'T WORK OUT. Please don't say we sorry to hear your problem etc etc. Just get it fixxxxxxed okay. TQ
This app is a way for the bank itself to scam its patrons. With how the bank forces patrons to use this non-functioning app to make any transfers. Its best to just close the account and go to another bank.
I need to approve transaction on the app but it keep getting error 500. Being trying for few days already in hoping it back to normal. Now I'm late to pay for things because of this app. QR also so slow. Hope the team can have a full testing on the app before release to public. Thank you
stupid app. on hari gaji day cannot log in due to high volume traffic. it said for alternative to use the website. but when do the transaction with the website they need the secure code that is sent to the app. so cannot do also. stupid
Don't know how to say,but I'm really disappointed, because of this app, i rather like the old version cause it can access fast and quick, rather than this version, i know the future in this app are improving,but please improve the system also, worst
worst banking apps ever! Keep loading ended up with server error and taking like ages just to do simple onlind transfer. The apps really testing my patience!! Latest update June23: I thought Bank Islam GO improved! But worsen. Keep telling us to clear cache, but nothing good is happening! Please remove requirement to use GO if your apps capability and quality is not yet UP to minimum standard expected! Feeling frustrated as LOYAL client of Bank Islam for yearsssss!
the app becoming more worse than ever.. every transaction more than Rm100 need to approve from this very baaaaaaaaaaaaaadd app, and yet user can't even login.. its keep buffering FOREVER! fix this already.. its been months i've tolerated, clearing cache everytime i need to login.. you've done NOTHING to improve
so bad. took too long to login even when not on payday. maybank2u is much better. how logically could u think that it keep saying high traffic whenever i tried to login while my friends could easily login. i am sure that this is not about phone issue
I dont understand why the apps is slow. I'd rather doing the online banking using google chrome. It is faster compared to the apps itself. I hope Bank Islam will address this issue as soon as possible
No offense, I know it is the goverment orders to use secure2u in mobile apps for verification relating to any online payments but you gotta fix the unstable problems of your mobile apps as soon as possible, guys. It's hindering day to day operations.
It always have an issues such as hard to log in, take very long time when loading and unable to connect with server. I'm sick of this kind of problems. Please fix it.
I tend not to give any star for the apps..... Always stuck at startup and cannot login this apps.... More than a month this issue still status quo.. Not sure what are the action taken by Bank Islam team.....if there is a chance, for sure will transfer all to another bank acc....
Dear team..why i cannot open the app?it keep saying "unable to connect server".i already install and uninstall many time..this is the third day i keep install and uninstall...i notice when have event on that month bank islam apps will be crash every day..please improve your trafic to avoid this kind of situation..this is second time i comment at here..but still no improvement.
I need to make a important transfer right now and the app is not working like it took too much time for loading and it sign out it own. Really really bad experience and so disappointed with this app right now.
App is laggy and full of error. I have uninstalled and reinstalled. But still cannot open the app. It stated that error 500. Please do something! I cannot transfer my money online because the approval need to be done on apps
Always experiencing failed transactions when I start to use this Go App system. I really don't like it. Not convenient to use it. It's better for not using this system. I think I should use other bank.
Frustrating, tried to make a transaction by web because the apps won't stop load and stuck on the welcome page, but then after inputing all the info required still need to approve the web transaction by apps which i can't open hmmmm
Worst apps ever. They keep loading all the time. However, I can smoothly use the other bank apps, so it's not an issue with my internet connection. I had no problems when using Chrome for bank Islam Internet banking
The most irritating online banking app. Now need to approve in bank Islam Go for online transaction, while I cannot even access to the app. Gosh need to do something about it. Always unavailable. So not helpful at all.
How did you managed to mess it up? it was doing fine before. right now its just impossible to even log into the app. loads forever and suddenly system is currently unavailable.
The worst ever apps compared to other competitor banks. Unable to open, keep loading and loading... Once u able to login, keep delayed in receiving the TAC... So many issues...bad customer experience...
Really great to whomever force this app of any transaction. Who's idea would great enough to forcely link any transaction with an app so buggy. Bring back message code! This app is not suitable for older phone!!!
As a customer, I am gonna be very honest. Did you see all the bad reviews here? Everyone of them filed the same complain and it seems you did not take any action for the matter. If that does not ring a bell, let me tell you the problem, your apps are extremely lagging, it frequently jammed which cause my transaction cancelled, I am embarassed when the cashier waiting for me to pay for 30 MINUTES, 30 MINUTES, I'm not even exaggerate, this happens too often. You must fix the problems immidiately.
Very poor apps, even no issue with Internet speed, the apps still lag for a few minutes. Most stressful bcoz need to approve transactions via go secure but apps hang to open
First time login, masuk kan sms FA, error 500 Edit: switch lines & retry. Work like a charm. Edit2: everytime there's new update I have to key in password and set fingerprint setting again, this is stupid and wasting time. Please fired your app vendor!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What can i say. I am a truly frustrated, disappointed user. This apps is way below the normal standard of other online banking apps such as m2u, cimbclicks etc. I would even give 0 star if google allows me to! Update 24/6/2023: This apps is still suxx. No improvement at all. Even worse than before. I would still go for 0 star!
Bad experience. Slow apps just to load the login page. For certain payment, need approval from apps, but this apps stuck. Please invest to improve and overcome the bottleneck especially on the salary day.
Having a nightmare with this app, keeps on circling until the requested times are up. Not once, can't recalled the experience. Truly disaster
This app really make my business even worse. Take a really long time to loading which I need to delay my important transaction just to wait it loading. The server always error. Really hard to go with this app.
This apps was performing from normal to bad . Now going from bad to worse. Please do something. Upgrade it, make it faster and don't forget about improving it's safety features.
The worst online banking app in the history ever made! What kind of degen software developers that you hired huh? I can't even open the app after the update. Takes 9999 years to load! If you can't be sure that this app can performs flawlessly then don't publish at all! Just stick to the website one man! You're losing a lot of customers here trust me! And I'm wasting googolplex of my timea Not recommended at all!
Dear bank islam....just delete this app from Google play. This app exist just to ruin my day and my storage...if it's won't able to function well then there is no reason for it to exist. It's been a decade and this problem seem to be remain unsolved like forever. Thanks for providing stupidest online banking app ever 👍. Just don't wanna harsh but if soft spoken won't so why don't?
Please hire someone that really good in IT. So, your user can using this app easily and more faster like a cheetah. Your apps now is almost being near with useless. PLEASE FIX IT!! FIX IT!! FIX IT!!
I need to APPROVE my transaction with this app, but this app can't even open!! You do realise that people have to do transaction on the web BECAUSE the app DOESN'T WORKK!! Now you want us to use your useless app to approve that transaction?! Who's stupid idea was this??!! Worst banking app I've ever experienced!! Just abolish the app and focus on the web!! The app is an epic FAILURE!!!!!
They always pending my transaction.. my money also successful transfer but when i check in another account, my money still stuck. it happened 2x to me and now i stuck again my transaction! Please improve your system !
I'm out of words. Really. Setiap update membuat app bertambah teruk. I am not even sure whether our complaints are taken into account, it looks like we are replied by the bot. Tak tahu apa solusi tech team Bank Islam untuk masalah berpanjangan mengenai app, bertahun-tahun ini. Menyusahkan keadaan. Transactions perlu approved melalui app, and yet the app itself failed to load at THE VERY BEGINNING OF LAUNCH. Transaksi kami ni jenaka ke, bagi Bank Islam?
This is worst app experienced that I ever had... The loading screen took way too long and sometimes you cant even open the app for the whole day. This have caused me lot of problem
The app is slow even though my internet connection is good because the other apps are okay. I can open them fast but not this app. Thank you Update: Assalamualaikum bank islam. Saya rasa pihak bank islam dah sedia maklum tentang apps online banking yang sangat slow. Ramai cakap benda sama. Saya rasa boleh slowly take action instead of suruh buat aduan kat email etc.
12/07 - I had to install and uninstall it a few times. Not just normal update. Super stress!!! Hari ni nak login tak boleh keluar error 500 APZ_TSN_500. Apa ni Bank Islam, ulang tahun ke 40, servis makin teruk. 14/07 - 2 times transaction failed because of loading time took more than 3 minutes. Bank Islam tolonglah upgrade server.
Buggy, loading... if happen surely need re-install back. Edited: Now the response getting ok. Just my favourite from website not available in apps, need to re-add. Overall ok easy, good & smooth. #keepitup
Previous version more compatible compared for right know. Keep loading and crash. Please⁹x,make iit be an enjoyable apps ro use. Not getting more stress from it
Always problematic to open. Now for the past few days, i continuously getting error to open the app. Trying to uninstall and reinstall. Same problem. Truly useless app.
The apps is super duper lagginggggg!! Sometime after the long wait can login to the system but sometime will just show error message! Clear cache multiple times also not working 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I need to use the apps to do online transactio but can't even open the apps. Loading je memanjang..tekan ape2 keluar blank page..stop depend on the apps if the apps is always crash.
Slow, then suddenly my account have a limit for transferring to other accounts even though it is less than the daily limit set beforehand. Try asking help from support but its useless.
the latest version for bank islam is so disappointed. it make hard to the late version of phone to be install that application especially for the older one . is it the best that you can do for the people who was using ur application ? if this keep happening, it's only make people to choose another bank 😤
Very slow. Please improve your app. After all these years of update, transaction become worsed as you still need to open the apps even using web biz page. Very unprofessional of handling customer complaints. Shameful
Previous version much better than new update. To Developer this app supposed to help user & enhanced ur security not give burden on them. Manager, Sales, Pre-Sales, Marketing & Developer please improved your application before we change to used other services. Thank you.
Before this the app is just okay, but yesterday an error message keeps popping up and wouldn't disappear and I cannot make any transactions using Bank Islam. I have Deleted the app yesterday.
Worst mobile banking app ever, slow and sometimes just does not work. If in an emergency the person would have died waiting for the app to start.
ALWAYS UNABLE TO CONNECT TO THE SERVER / NO FUNCTION Cannot approve the transaction since cannot login into the Go by Bank Islam apps. VERY STUPID apps. NOTORIOUS for crashing. Like always the pegawai bank will only say sorry for inconvenience. The fact is, on customer's part, it is not inconvenience but a difficult hindrance to the transaction. TAKE NOTE BANK ISLAM. DON'T BE BITTER WITH THIS COMMENT BUT GET BETTER!!
I guess it is either the dev team is underpaid or you lots just plain idiot with no brain. Wasted half an hour just to make an instant transfer to another account. I don't wish you guys the dev team success. The Dev team doesn't deserve to be happy or successful in this world due to their "phenomenal" banking app. No improvements since the last 3-4 years. Lazy developers!
This app so problematic, try to login since yesterday and still its loading though I have good internet. I couldn't make any payments. Even CIMB I can login with 512 kbs when I'm run out of data.
too bad when opening his apps, always loading. why is this happening? his service is too bad. It's really hard for me to transfer money to other people because it's hard to open their apps, just load them Please take immediate action.tq
As a student using bank islam is really difficult.Because most off the time this app is not working properly.if we want to top up or transfer the money it's really hard for us. Most of the time this app is not working properly....
Very unfriendly user. Takes a very long time to load. Unexpected time to make a maintenance and everything bad combine in one app
recently using this app is difficult and unpleasant, since it takes too long to open and also frequently not responding. very frustrating since i cant settle my bills and payment as planned.
Suddenly show a server network error and even after reinstall the app, its good for a few hours then the same thing happen again. Fix this thing
The worst ever. Install uninstall for three times. Still cannot open the apps. Better dont have the apps if its can't be open or lagging all the time.
So far the slowest mobile Internet banking app i ever used..still can't open the apps after 10 minutes waiting.. Affect my payment / transfer every month.. Bank islam should have assess again this apps.. Using website is better, but still need secure number from apps..
I'm sorry but please please please hire someone who can really do the jobs right. Why this app always laggy and buggy.. why it keeps reloading... how many times do I have to keep key in the information.. so not user friendly
Worst app ever. Might consider to change to other banks if you don't improve / upgrade your apps. Update on 25/6/23: still cannot use. Don't bother to download this app. USELESS
I was using bank Islam website to transfer but couldnt and the website told me to download the apps. Now i cant even login the apps because there is error popup. The worst apps, service and a waste of time.
Please improved the apps for better experience..regret to use it as my main bank transaction...anything related on online payment so lembap bapak lahh..link with go transactions not sync, pending and transaction will be invalid..did not sure amount transaction were deducted or not..to open apps / using qr paid kena sidai macam hape.bende laa bank apps mcam ni.letihlaa...
I couldn't even open up the apps, such a bummer! I need to do instant transfer, but the apps didn't help at all. Do better with the apps Bank Islam..
I don't know what happened but it seems I can't log in into my account, is it under maintenance? Because it always log out when I'm login. Hard for me to make transaction
Please improve your system. Seriously so stress when people using to play. 1st thing is the GO app. No need actually when we using OTP. Then always system is currently not available. My God seriously so stressed. improve improve improve please🙏🏽
Worst application ever. The application should be more easier but became more harder. Cannot use the application at all. I even cannot pay my bill.
The slowest apps that universe can handle. I think, it is faster to go to the bank, take a number and que at the counter just to know my account balance than waiting this app to load.
The previous one i think much better. The new version i cant even log in, it just keep on loading and loading 🙂 please fix the issue.
Can't open the app for so long. How to transfer my money?? Even when i'm trying to topup my shopee pay, I cant use this bank because I need to open the app to authorize the transaction. Please improve asap 😠
(Edited) Now, the app navigation seems ok for me. So i add 2 star more from my original 1 star review before. Also, for not be able to see my transactions history pains me. So no more star for you for now
VERY VERY BAD!!!! WHY THE SYSTEM IS VERY SLOW UNLIKE MAYBANK. Bfr this, I can buy the ticket without need to download the go bank Islam apps. But today suddenly I must use the app to settle the payment. This app is very bad & please do not trouble us as the bank Islam users with your bad system.
Trash apps, sorry for the harsh word but come on Bank Islam? Already 2021 but still with this kind of apps. Hardly stable to use. People use mobile apps for convenience not to get more headache haiya. Update : 2023 still trash. Both website and mobile apps cannot be used at all. Don't bother using Bank Islam anymore
Update your system properly. What's the use of keep updating but the outcome got worse. Ugh if it's not for my uni i would never use this trashy app. BANK ISLAM PLEASE IMPROVE YOUR SYSTEM. THE PROBLEM HAS ONGOING FOR SO LONG BUT THERE'S NO ACTION TAKEN? WORST BANKING APP EVER
i want to review without giving A star actually. This app always bug . if i uninstall and install back, i have to wait another 12 hours so i can use the transfer method and others . what a problematic app . VERY TROUBLESOME .
Always high volume of traffic. Not ideal for emergency. Loading time takes too long. Need more than 10 minutes just to load up QR.
This app is really terrible. It's always have problems and when you enter the app, it's take too much time to load. Mybank app is better in my opinion.
I can't even open the apps after the update! Worst banking apps ever. It make the transactions more difficult/ almost impossible!!!
I want to online transfer, but due to apps server error, i need to wait until it's okay. No option like TAC or other if something happen like this. Poor apps.
Slowest apps to be honest..Please take your users opinion for better result..We suffer more than anyone everytime we try to make transition,transfer and everything..Please make sure your apps run more smoothly..TQ
Super slow after updates, login, transaction ,then after finish transfer ,it log out ,then try to login again, access denied. Done reinstall. Still problem occur .please check .
Downloaded it for the first time today and all I get is "Server Error: Unable to connect to the server". What a waste of time. Not going to bother trying it later in the future if it can't even function.
Trying to open the apps but got an issues on the server, tried to uninstall it but until today its failed, please resolve this issues ASAP (15/12/22). UNTIL TODAY THIS IS ISSUES IS NOT RESOLVE (02/08/23)
Please bank Islam improve your application. It takes time to open and sometimes there have many errors.. It's easy to use but the loading and errors make me annoyed.
Recevied error message "Reach maximun of user id". After de-listed user and add new user. Please fix this issue. I believe this is only minor issue.
I wanted to do the transaction request from other app, then it asked me to redirect to this app to continue the transaction. But when i opened this app, it suddenly said "please reinitiate the transaction" and the app stuck with that popup window.
Too Slow and unstable. Its year 2023. Even a 'Car Wash' business has an apps now. Your internal budget for online banking apps and marketing must have been gone to somewhere else,i predict. Lastly, 'Riba' is haram😁
Really disappointing with the BANK ISLAM application, it should be easier for every customer when they want to make an online transaction, there must be a problem, please fix it don't waste the customer's time many times have faced this problem very disappointing.
Just updated today and your app just gave me an "Error 500" What does that mean and I've tried uninstall and reinstall a couple of times but it still gives me that error code 500.. please help!
cant login. the same id and password were use in desktop,but keep on sying "invlid credential" in apps. i cant transfer money as the desktop online bankin ask to install this app to setup something at its setting. now useless.
Bad service ever, i wanted to login but keep denying even though already put the right password, then i have to wait within 12 hours before i can proceed for any payment after change the password, please make sure to update this thing
Worst bank app. Most of the time cannot login, high traffic error, lag & slow. I will rate 0 star if given the option.
The bank fund did not reflect the amount I have in my account. When open via website, it shows the amount. But in the app only show zero ringgit.
Slow when open the app and even slower when opened using mobile data. Please fix it ASAP, a lot of people using duitnow and online banking for everyday transaction.
Apps always problem and slow response. Its not convenient if you are in a hurry. This is the worse banking app period.!
Take a long time to just load the screen. For what forcing us to stop using the website and use the apps . Seriously ? Not convenience
Hello Bank Islam, what kind of improve if your apps always stuck and loading? Really troubling the user. The most trouble apps bank that i used, sorry not gonna used this apps anymore, you guys never take this as lesson. Bye forever and ever !!
the application is really bad .. it's been two days since I've been trying to enter or login , I can't .. oh my god . It's hard to make a transaction..
Forced to install to enable online transfer. Installed, went through all the stupid steps, logged me off multiple times. 2 hours in I still can't do anything. Modern day robbery.
Apps is SOOOO problematic. HAVE TO REACTIVATE QR CODE FOR EVERY.SINGLE.USE??!! LOAD TIME?FOREVER EVEN WITH WIFI😑 you update the apps but nothing happens 😩
Very slow apps, difficult to do online transaction (always received error), cannot use screenshot for proof of payment use, always received error so many times, very bad apps...
Please acknowledge all the reviews you received. This apps received 1 star for most of the ratings and bad feedbacks but still no improvement from the admin. Please do something and improve your apps. This apps just make things harder. Even 1 star is over rating.
The worst app i have been used. Update , update, update but nothing improve. Each transaction (above limit) need to approve by app, but cannot open to approve. So HOW? Really annoyed. Does not deserve even for 1 star. Shd be 0.
Not even worth of one star. Slow, sluggish. Login using fingerprint will fail most of the time.
Bro..seriously, i am in urgent to do the transaction and the apps keep on crashing. Open by browser, and need to confirm transaction by using this apps. Seriously?
Very bad system. Doing the transaction online always on lag i can die because of this system makes my food transaction always failed. Shame on you.
The current version is take time to open compared to old version. It's really annoyed. Please upgrade the system.
Cannot even start the app, now online banking through regular web cannot perform online transaction, what other option the user has for online transaction then? Please fix the app. Thank you
Disappointed!! The worse apps in my phone. Eventhough Im using browser, i still need to authorised my transaction through this apps. The problem is i can't even open it. Shame on you bank islam.
Bank islam service didn't improve their log in apps delay even few years. Very bad
Loading takes forever using Redmi note 11s but run smoothly on redmi note 11 pro 5g.
Why got problem when to open ? The app want loading until when ?? Until I have child or i die ? I can't to make payment ! It's so very double triple bad !! Very and very triple disappointed !!!
I do not know why the app so lagging. This really affect my transactions for biz. Have to restart over and over end up using on the web to transfer.
Too many error. From log in up to transferring fund. Please fix the apps, or just remove it from apps store if u are not going to fix it
Bila nak upgrade apps ni? Basic function pun tak tercapai. Duk loading memanjang. Malu la sikit dengan apps Maybank. Contohi apps mereka. . Update: developer noob. Cannot provide even the basic function of the apps
This stupid thing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!@@×!×@!×+I can't load to the app. It's says cannot connect to server. Have been trying many times, still failed 😔
I found that the latest fixes/releases makes this apps better and user friendly
The apps keep on loading until time to do transactions out. Worst banking apps ever.. I had to go to the bank to do it manually..
Please upgrade your apps, hard to access. Sometimes need to wait loading for long time before and after login. Functionality too slow..2 star at the moment until its run smoothly
Very bad experience with this app, please upgrade your system. Poor, incompetent, waste of time, awful at the every corner...
Pls fix ur server or whtever issue it is. I hve experiencing ths issue since ths early 2023 n i have limited patience. I hve been considering changing my bank acc bcos of ths apps
not even worth 1 star. just like other reviewer, the app is now worse after the update. Loading takes forever, online transaction took so long despite having fast internet. Lagi update lagi teruk hmmm
Not deserve a star at all. BIMB need to do drastically changes to make sure this app functionally correctly. Else, it will leads to customer loss to other conventional bank services.
App doesnt do anything (almost all time i used it)! DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING IF IT IS NOT BROKEN!
It takes too long to loading.. And the apps crashed frequently.. it makes it hard to get approval for duitnow system..
Horrible.What is wrong with your apps? Now it is very slow to access my account.It keep on logging, until I give up.. You must keep up with other banks' app!
Previous version much better. Current version always lagging & it is troublesome when i want to use it urgently. Hopefully BIMB can do something.
Always error opening the app. Showing high traffic everytime !!! How to confir. TAC if app always crash ?? Shame lah u manage this app. 😡😡
Lembap gile app ni...nak open app took very long period that I can made coffee baru bole bukak... sometimes the app cannot open cause having inconvenient problem... developer please improve this damn app and fix the problem...other bank apps work smoothly but this app work very dull
Bagus. The banking app has been improved a lot! Thanks!
The apps cannot open or even to register. Also, you need to open the apps for approval transaction even you are doing money transfer through website.stupid application.
if theres a zero star review i would give it to this app...Like seriously?...Why do you need to make a payment everytime we need to go through the app? its stupid and slow
Too bad the apps so bad la. 2 days waiting to make transaction still cannot do. Using website also crashed. Please make an improvement asap.
Very slow. Rubbish app. Sorry to say.
After update cannot open the apps until today.Pervious apps more better.
Update review: JUST PERISH! My balance was deducted when I am sure I never made any transaction recently. This is after updating the app as of 2 oct 2023. App keep showing no transaction history at all! The worst banking app ever. Slow loading, not to mention you have to log in to this trashy banking app whenever you need to verify online transactions through go secure, but sometimes it doesn't even show up. Update and UPGRADE your feature and loading rate or just terminate this app entirely.
Another update and yet this app still disapponts. This time, merely logging in to the app itself is time consuming and stress-inducing; let alone performing online banking transactions via the app, God knows how long it will take. My previous review prevails with add-ons to the already long complaint. Rather appalling given the slow page loading and difficulty of connecting to the app. It was quite frustrating and inconvenient when the app was supposed to have 'streamlined' online banking.
Apps always lagging, some times not responsed, please solve the problem a.s.a.p
Very very bad services. Apps cannot be open and seldomly successful to make transaction. Hoping there will be improvement in near future
The apps keep loading and unable to login.
The worst bank app ever! Its always loading and takes too much time for me to use qr pay. I end up using other bank app which is more fast and efficient
Worst experience ever. Loading takes forever. Simple assignment cannot be done. Plan your schedule weeks ahead or just accept that nothing can be done through this app
Using this apps for quite long and already updated the latest version,but i'm still don't see the improvement using this apps. Worst and too slow.
It's very, way too annoying! Don't bother making an app if you don't intend for it to work! It's been a year or more since I have this app and it keeps crashing all the time. Can count with my finger how many times it work during a year! Please fix this or just delete this app from the playstore, u r making its hard since want to pay shoppee also got through this piece of app!
Can't even open smh.. Alr update, now can open but cannot log in..
Worst working apps. That's I can conclude about this apps..unable to connect to server, traffic bla bla bla. So frustrated.
Apps cant login. Wth is this!? Why do we need to get the securego from the apps when the apps can't even open?! Please fix! I have tons of bills to pay wih due dates!!!
Whoever in charge with developing this app should resign, not competent at all, most of the time not working
I have tried many times to login still cannot login and the password is wrong eventhough i have entered the password correctly. Still having the same problem
This app has been the lousiest since from the beginning. I hope the team will rectify the issue. Everytime error!
the most retarded app on planet, how could this app still exists at this moment. even a snail would be faster than this app, and whose idea was it to confirm the online purchase through this stupid app and thought it would be a great idea when it is slow as hell ?
Its sincerely getting worse!! Its keep loading without getting anywhere. Please fix this asap.. Ppl use it everyday.. If we just open it for it to be loading, then what the point???
Poor app. Not go for user friendly. Not easy to access. Unable to connect the server 😞😞😞
Not happy with the apps efficiency. Loading, loading, loading until the time ended. Please improve your efficiency. So upset
Please fire all of your swqa and dev team and management , lots of bugs in this app slow loading time, lots of items in app dissappearing reappearing randomly
Bank Islam Go is testing my patience. Banyak kena istighfar, banyak kena ingat kepada Allah because when you need to open the app, you can't because of high volume or because they're experiencing technical issues. Fix the app, Bank Islam, once and for good.
As of now (6/11/23 11.51pm) the app stays on loading page. Tried with different type of internet connection but it's still loading. Didn't have any issues through bimb webpage. Only the app. Already tried to restart the phone and open the app again though. P. S: after reading all the recent reviews, makes me wonder, does the latest version of the app is still very bad?
Fixed the rooted device issue on my last review. It gets the job done, but not in optimal way. I'd rather browsing through website compared to this. Loading each page was slow, even website version load faster. Whenever I wanted to do transfer be it IBG or Instant Transfer, I have to reinput my password again. I cannot use fingerprint authentication, as it was only for first app login. Another hassle for me.
Trash app. Can't even load the login page
I cannot open the app after so many tries. This makes it harder to do a transfer. Please resolve the problem faster. Thank you.
Transaction error error error error error non stop. Seriously noob, super useless especially TAC, making functional apps and services super trash. Just fired whoever team that development this apps.
The worst worst worst worst bank apps ever!!!!!! Take forever to load even though the wifi signal is good.. The web server is better than this stupid apps!!! But the web server is not that good also!!!!
I hardly login to this apps nowadays..It keeps loading,showing the circling icon everytime when ever I try to open it. Delete and reinstall many times,but the problem still the same..If this keep happens, I wont be able to use my Bimb online services since it is required to be approved from this apps, and it is so troublesome.
The worst banking app in Malaysia I've used. Everything loads up very poorly. You want to pay some stuff at the store using qr? Well, you'd die of old age first. Even the Bank Islam website sucks. People that uses this intentionally are masochists.
Supposed to be, an app make things easier. But this apps make things harder. Everytime I downloaded it, I need to key in the data like I'm a totally new user. Although I re-install it on the same device. Worst experience is today. When it magically TOTALLY log out. And when I try to login, it told me to key in data like I'm a new user. Need to re-setup qr pay. Need to key in IC number. The same app that has been running quite a few times before this on the same device. Deserve 0 star I think.
After the new update version, I cant log in as the notifications keep on saying "unable to connect to the server" which is very hassle and time consuming to deal with. Very disappointed with the buggy apps and it doesnt seem helpful at all. Not sure if this happens to android users only or not.
Very very very poor online bank service. Have to try sooo many times before your transaction success using this apps. Please improve your poor service guys.
Apps got lots of prob during startup. Reinstall and its gna deauthorize ir registered phone when all u want is to use back. Trash quality.
Bad interface and the worst of all, the line and the online services of the app is barely bearable at most. 0 star.
The apps took time for every process even log in also take too long . Very dissapointed . Sometime its very hard to make money transfer 👎
What happen to this app, it took more time to open it, sometime it waste my time to wait just to transfer the money but in the end i could't.
Fix the bugs and improve the server.
Been using the apps but lately the apps become suck. Super snail and giving a fuss to the customers. Please do something fast or ur going to loose a lot of customers
Apps selalu error. So bila nak transfer, guna biz online, tapi tetap perlu approval dari apps ni yg langsung tak boleh buka. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bank islam should remain with web saja. No need app. Youre not ready to use app bila selalu error. Menyusahkan user.
Very disappointed with the apps. Take very long time to login and even cant doo fpx transaction. This app should make life easier with cashless payment nowadays.
The Go app sooo slow n not responsive in good time. Its take too long for app to activate..its not help for urgent matter when to used it.
I can't open up the apps .. how i'm gonna make transaction? 😭 i already update to the latest One
When we r already at the cashier and the apps dont even work. There and then we tried to uninstal n reinstal.. but sometimes it wont work also after reinstall 🥲
Slow , Cannot do any transfactions. Then its better after the comments
unresponsive. very slow. give you good hard headache .
Till still dont have any updated. I cant even open my app. Why your system is too bad? Please solve this problem! Why have update when is causing more trouble to user!
It is definitely the slowest bank application in Malaysia. I have Maybank, Standard Chartered, Public Bank, UOB, Alliance, OCBC application in my phone. Bank Islam easily the winner in this category. Keep up the good work although I highly doubt that any other bank will be able to defeat you in term of buggy and laggy.
Worst bank app. Slow and always not responsive. Please, I BEG of you, please, make development for this app. Make it function as good as other bank apps.
Please upgrade your online banking system.There is always a problem when users want to log in and always use the excuse that your internet line is problematic but in fact it is not.Please take action as soon as possible because many users want to use it to pay all commitments.Thank you
cannot open the app after the update. Should fix this as it keep on loading for a long time.It still cannot open up to 3 days until now.
So slow to open this app, hopefully this problem will be solve in tge future.
Frequently lags. Loading to log in page very slow. Overall not very secure.
App Server always shows a slow as a snail app's navigation. Kindly check the server in case of hacker intrusion.
Very bad apps. The loading time is so long & it's really not convenient to use it compared to website. If you want to develop an apps make sure it is user friendly and very dissatisfied with this apps. Every transaction is very difficult and make your worry whether it is already successful to be transfer or not. Please make a change. Thank you.
I cannot open the app since I downloaded the new version. It kept showing the Unable to Connect to Server box everytime I open the app. I have been using it for 2 years and it got its up and down, but this time is the worst. And since everything needed to be aunthenticate using the Go app, found it very inconvenient and a huge hassle. Please do something about it. Thank you.
This app is extremely terrible, shame on the developers for not fixing it. Might as well use other alternatives than this slowpoke.
The login part kinda slow while waiting for loading. Sometimes, it freezes and crashed.
Always need updated. Every transaction need approval by secure site (this case, by Bank Islam Go)..but pending and buffer too much. Not user friendly...
Slow, lag and not user friendly
Very bad IB apps. Always shows error even though it has been updated to the latest. Please do something for the customers or else Bank Islam IB will always receive bad reviews.
Slow and laggy..almost every time cant sign in..need to relaunch the app several times.. tonight issue "cant connect to server".
After I put id, password, ic, I waited for a long time to get IAC number but it didn't send it to my mobile number! It's so annoying app!
"unable to connect to server" this problem has occurred few months now. very troublesome. edit : after reinstall this app, I finally can use it as before. BUT, the loading screen before entering the password took FOREVER 😢 if any of you having the same issue, and you are reading this, please clear the app's cache. it makes the app smoother
Loading slow, cant do transaction without it. So much for security when u cant even do a simple transaction
Love this apps. Easy and convenience to access. Go Bank Islam dah BETTER. Alhamdulillah.
PLEASE HIRE BETTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPER. CUSTOMER CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE. SLOW SLOW SLOW, MAINTENANCE ALL THE WAY. SOMETIMES FUNCTION CAN'T BE USED. REBOOT THIS APP PLEASE.
The apps is getting worse day by day. Been waiting for more than 10 mins just to get in...and sometimes didn't even get to log in.
This app is getting worsen day by day, super slow and laggy and not advanced like other banks apps. Please improve your apps service.
Your rating now 1.3..only 1 star..probably ending with no star if playstore allow us... each time update your apps keep freezing... stuck at loading page..do something.. look at your competitor..maybank..cimb...all good
Previous version is better..i cannot see my balance in TH after the update
Bad experience.. alway lag and have lots of problem especially on QR Code and scanning.. why even develop this app if you have no intention to maintain it?
to slow connection..fail..upset...more complicated
This app is really slow, maybe because of the server. Really need to upgrade the responds time for the sistem.
It's fine when it works, but right now it doesn't work more often than it does. Which is a problem since BIMB is now forcing their clients to use this app for transaction approvals. When you want to do that, then the app needs to be reliable, which this app is obviously not. It's taken me several tries and I still can't transfer my money.
Please la... So slow when open the apps, for 30+ min only "pusing-pusing". And please consider to bring back TAC since you apps can't even open to authorize my purchase
The GO secure function is really frustrating. Always didn't work in crucial time. Please do something with your apps.
New update problem. This app stuck at asking me to accept / reject payment. But I did not do any payment. Please repair the problem.
Worst app ever, unable to log in around pay day week 25th until end of month for every month. Really difficult to make any online transaction during this period.
Cannot scan qr from gallery..i already have latest version on my one plus 11
Worst ever, cannot check available balance at all. Any banking payment also lag and too slow. What happen????
da update.. tapi apa yg lambat sgt nk bukaknya..yg lama lagi better than new veraion.. take so long to. open.. disappointed betul dgn isu apps bank islam ni
This app keep loading everytime we try to use it. It really annoying since every online transaction need to be verified by this app.
Loading too long, access denied, then say i had logged in, cant even open in web, clear data and force stop then working, this apps clearly is broken.
Update in April 2023 It's becoming worse. I can't even open the app even after reinstalling it after clear history, cache and reset phone. Recent update is causing problems to open the app. I am unable to use it completely. It take ages to open as well as use the GO verification. I uninstalled, clear cache multiple times with wifi and data connection without any success. I am sure the problem comes from the app itself.
This is most worst bank app in Malaysia. I wonder why Uitm compulsory for student to use Bank Islam as main student bank account?. App very slow, always show loading bubble, I'm unable to log in to app. Bank Islam you are multimillion company, you are supposedly able to upgrade and fix app without problem. New update: I'm done!!!. Time to close Bank Islam account or let's account became dormant. I'm suggest user closed account and change to Maybank MAE and Cimb Octo or transfer to TNG E-wallet.
Bank islam banking app is the slowest and the worst . Server always doesnt work. Imagine trying to pay using the app and u just stare at the loading white page for 30 minutes
I hv tried mny times to pay my bills last few days but never can log in go apps. U shud provide alternative. So disappointing.
Unable to do fund transfer. Keep getting error code. The basic function of transferring money is not properly develop.
Why i cannot check my Tabung Haji account? The apps already update latest version 10. Please assist
I've updated this app and I've lost RM13 once I logged in. Have been checked the transaction history and didn't know where it goes. I still remember the balance in my account. Plus, I just went to ATM a week ago. The amount is still fresh in my head. Got the receipt too. I'm truly disappointed and can no longer trust it. What if losing large amount of money after this? It's scary. I guess I should uninstall this app :( it's no longer secure for me
Why always loading, take to long loading, sign out suddenly, need to uninstall and install back and came out with box that stated i need to performed transaction to TH, DUIT NOW AND OTHERS AFTER 12 HOURS.
I keep on getting 'unable to connect to server' issues and sometimes had to reinstall the apps due to crash and all. Is there any explanation to this? Issues like this have made it so difficult for me to make a transaction especially on important one. So, I'm truly disappointed. I hope you all can fix this. It hindred people's business and matter. Also, why does the app won't allow screenshot? Sometimes, I forgot to share my receipt and try to find back my transaction record but can't screenshot
Please fix... keep getting error exceeded daily limit when making transaction. Need to switch using browser instead, such a hassle...
The apps keeps crashing even i uninstall it. My id also cannot be detected. Why it keeps on loading????
Very disturbing.. every transactions becomes hard due to error of system. It takes time and not efficient at àll. Please update ur service at it is very slow and not working. The service is still not working despite having reinstalled a few times. Saying that I haven't registered though just send me verification of successful register.!!???
Worst banking apps. Keep loading although internet line is good. Unable to access the app for online transactions. Please improve
After the update, the app keep crashing and pop up said "server error, unable to connect to server". This has been going for weeks and I can't use duitnow for most of my purchases and transfer which is frustrating. Why the update bring down the app instead of "fixing the bug" like the update state. I'm mortified and scared at the thought my account can be easily hacked while the app crashing.
Much more worst. I cannot login to my acc and usually if i want to login, it always pop out 'high volume of traffic.' what-
why need to relaunch the app for confirmation in online transaction, seriously then it stuck just loading forever. please fix asap ! edit : if i can give 0 star i will give it, have been use for a long time and theres no imrprovement in this app, what are you doing? cant this app be like other bangking app?
Forced to stay hungry the whole day without money because app is down & online banking down, and contactless card transaction cannot be used. I really hate this bank.
Looking forward for better online service. This apps too slow for loading and frequent error issue on server.
too slow and laggy. sometimes need to wait for a long time to login. when to approve transaction even took a long time. please improve tremendously your app bank islam.
Every time update new version. Making it more complicated in all ways. Fingerprint can't access, face recognition take times, need 2 times key in password, auto log out, buffering at all the time until i sleep and wake up on the next day and still buffering. Neither use android or ios, the experience of using is still the same, getting worse.
The worst banking apps... Always loading for so long. Had to do everything in website since the apps is always having prob.
App paling useless. Susah nk access, loading then lastly tak boleh nk buka pun.
Too slow to load in login page. I want to use urgently QR Pay yesterday.
i think no star for this application. very bad. so stress use this. take so long time to open. difficult to transfer/payment. waste time!!
Slow and this app should be optional, not users need to download your app just to use your services. Make it optional.
Worse bank app ever. Can't event log in. Take so much time to load around 5-10 minutes. Pls fix. I'm a student so it's hard for me to pay some stuff
App keeps getting crash and error for login. Please please fix this. Even nak bukak online punya kt website pun slow sangat ya. Do something to fix this asap.
Ever since the Error 500 appeared, the app collapsed and unable to be open. Tried deleting cache, data, force stop it but nothing works. I wanted to do simple transactions using DuitNow but I can't. Uninstalling and reinstalling is a lot of work because you have to setup your account back.
Why remove the option to make transactions using the website? Seems like another unnecessary application that you must download for basic banking service. At least give us a choice!
It has been almost a week i cant access to my account. Last week was due to huge traffic. Today, unable to connect to server.
Please fix this app. It is annoying when you need to transfer money urgently but this app takes tooooooo longgggg loading. Very bad app.
Really slow. I can't stress this enough. My patience is running even thinner every time I need to use this app. Why we need to authorise from the app when the app is this slow? I looked at your replies to the other users and they're just the same things being said over and over again. It really shows that you don't care about us. I already cleared the cache and uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but still can't even log in. I've done the best that I can, so why can't you guys do the same?
Super slow, super clunky, super inefficient
Bad..Cannot even open the app..many times say 'Currently under maintenance'. Hard to do transactions. Please fix the issue.
I cant open this apps after update!!!previous better than this!!! Fix it!!!
Unable to install ..only able to open using playstore then problem to do transfer ..I think this is worst app ever then other bank ...please do something
Very slow app, it take a long time just to open the app and most of the time i cannot access the app at all.
Deserves no star. The worst app for a bank. Loading too long. Always lag and crash. Serioulsly this app needs improvements
Where is the menu to view transaction signing? Adding or deleting favorite accounts has become difficult! If you click on the Transaction Signing notification bar while using the apps, it won't redirect to the correct page to approve the transaction. And there is no way to view the current Transaction Signing! Inbox messages cannot be clicked too! Disappointing! This apps is only good to view the current balance, that's all!
Among the dumbest feature with this apps is they didnt let me screen shot due to privacy policy THIS JUST REALLY EXTREMELY BOTHERING ME, I CANT SHARE MY PAYMENT PROOF BECAUSE I FORGOT TO SHARE THE PDF FILE AFTER I PAID MY SELLER AND I PROCEED TO HOME SCREEN END UP CANT TAKE SCREENSHOT ANYWHERE WITHIN THE APPS? WHY CIMB APPS DIDNT DO THIS? SO WHY WOULD YOU?
Can't login since yesterday. Already updated the app. 🤬
why this apps can't screenshot.. I can't give any proof too seller when i buy some thing when transfer the money. and this app always hank, then must uninstall n reinstall again n again..
No star for a bad apps. Im 1st time want to register. Cannot open at all and just appeared server error!!
Hello, I can't open my apps to check my account. It just said server error. Even the website can't be open. Please fix it.
I can't log-in to the app using my new phone. I have been installing and uninstalling the app for many time but the problem keep on going. Whenever I try to log-in, the app suddenly close. Like when i fill up my bank id and it started loading then the app close and it went back to my phone homepage. I tried many time and I nearly reach to the final step, but it still suddenly close. Please solve this problem quickly cause it is inconvenience to make a transactions thru the website. Thank you.
Always load for a very long time especially when I'm trying to make transaction causing the transaction to be cancelled.
one of the worse performing online banking app with multiple downtimes and bugs
Worst. Always encountered Server Error Unable to connect to the server. What should I do then???
After i updated, i cnnot log into the app anymore!
Makin Update, Makin teruk. Kena clear data storage setiap kali nak launch app ni...
Loading screen took so long and keep getting error message . Sometime biometric also cannot use .
A very unreliable piece of technology. Takes forever to go to login page, and sometimes even fail. I have to clear cache and storage then reopen to see the login page. To transfer money, the bank require the GO authorization but when you cannot even open the app and login this will make it useless. I suggest to first remove the need for GO authorization and stick to 6 digit codes until you guys fix the issues for your app. 1 star review overall is not a very good look for the brand. Best of luck
Cant open the app, it stuck on loading screen
Dear developer, This app always stuck on login. When log in to app, I cannot log in to other browser. I want transfer my money to pay for the thing i buy. Fix this god dam stupit mf apps lah weh. Learn from MAE, CIMB Click and others.. Developer lena ka..
Fix this app at least please. Cannot take screenshot for proof of payment. And loading , took forever. Apps is not so friendly user.
Need to approve transaction in app, app forever loading. At least give option for sms code for fak sake. Might actually change bank just because of this app
Please fixed this apps, it was not stable sometimes I can login using fingerprint sometime its cannot..if I can put 1/2 star ..that is your rating I can give to your app
Been using this app for years and it was smooth. But after recent update, it just went from good to worst! Whenever i tried to login, keep on pop-up 'unable to reach server'. Super annoying! Then i uninstall and re-install, looks fine but when i keyin my ic number, it detect as error. U guys please fix it asap.
By far the worst banking app. Always auto logged out due to the server issue. And to login will require few attempts which is ridiculous. The UI is bery basic and sometimes a bit confusing for example hard to notice which one is required field. Why don't you just suggest to re-install the app? BIMB User. Person_A: can just transfer me the money. Me: Great! Lemme uninstall and install this wonderful banking app.
problem app,i cannot open the apps for swveral times
Such a nuisance/ problematic/ inconvenient apps..need to do transaction asap, but not able to open apps or even online banking..what a turndown..improve la bank islam
I don't know what's wrong with Bank Islam app anymore. Previous version is more stable, easy and user-friendly. And now? Double menyusahkan users.
0.5 star if i can put here. The worst apps for banking. I cant even open the apps properly to accept the transaction. Just keep the tac style laa, dont copy other banking apps. Haiyaaa!
The worst online banking apps Ive used. It took forever just to load. Then another forever to load any payment methods.
Better than Road Runner . Just imigine.
The function of this apps make so difficult to transfer my money to make payment for my car n my grab n all my apps.. Why this apps took so long to loading. 2 days waiting n still loading.. Do something bnk islam why so weak
Shouldn't have given a star. First of all this is inconvenient at all. The website is much more better. I'm trying to do a single transaction over days but still can't. Go to 'Go secure' put in the digits still NOTHING. The needs to log in everytime and then the apps log out suddenly when making transaction so irritating. Plus the 'not valid' when literally just a second after log in. A single transaction but this much troubles is so frustrating. It's making me lost temper everytime.
Very bad. App is not working. Even after update. Any other way to do online transfer now?
I have been using the app for more than a year (maybe) and there have been massive improvements, kudos to the developers 👍🏻 I'm looking forward to future improvements especially in these 3 aspects - a more friendlier GUI (not too robot-ish please), a more complete/comprehensive transfer experience and frequent updates to fix the bugs. Additionally I have a question, the ability to add fav transfers is actually also not available on other banking apps, is it for security reasons?
I want to transfer money urgently but they asked to download the go bank apps. The darn app cannot even be accessed. Failed to connect to server. Wth
This is the worst app ever. I can't even tap go secure how do I want to transfer for online banking, this is so annoying
Worst app, always loading and high volume traffic. Need approvement and be like a maybank app easier to people. Go to online banking site also same.
The app suddenly cannot open , it say server error.. Already tried to uninstall and install back but still same. Why ahhh ayoooooooooo
System always down .. very hard to make online transaction . if this have ZERO star , i will rate this . Its been years !
Almost there with BSN with the most inefficient banking service in Malaysia. Useless apps / online platform every end of the month
Cant even access the apps..transfer through website but it to go to the apps to be able to transfer..but everytime i want to access cant even enter the apps..the apps always problem..
Pleaseeeeee update the app to be faster.I am really annoyed using this app.the login session itself took about more than one minute.please change your technical team or hire the better new team ASAP!
Apps are so slow and annoying. I keep getting access denied. Please improve it.
This app does not deserve even one star. Keep loading until forever cannot be used, always in high traffic issue.
not a good bank app. Loading for very long time. Got problem when to buy stuff on shopee & when i want to topup my internet. I can't take it anymore
Wouldn't even give this app a single star if I could. You forced us to use this app for such security reason but didn't even manage to even come with a good apps. Please do some quick improvements
The previous version is better. The current app is so slow and annoying. Please fix this ASAP!
The server always got error, please fix it! I can't even log in to my account because of that!
The apps is definitely less convenient than the website. But, nothing out of expectation. Because depending on the data you use the loading time of the apps may be slower or faster. Sometimes cannot use it because it was under maintenance but definitely not because of the apps itself if unable to use it. It also depends on your phone specs and storage. 😉
Getting worst day by day.Make it verify on the app after using the web for transaction.But the app was not working properly and immidiate urgent transaction all getting delay.
CAN'T USE AT ALL. LOADING FOR A LONG TIME THEN ERROR. TRIED UNINSTALL THEN REINSTALL BUT SAME RESULT. ITS BEEN ALMOST A WEEK. PLEASE FIX IT IMMEDIATELY. THANK YOU. IM A LONG-TIME USER
This app make me spoil to do on9 transaction still cannot use and so bad to me,ples take action to solve this problem ASAP to give and make excellent app for easy to use tq
Now can't even open app. Keeps saying high volume of traffic and tell us to try again later. EPIC FAIL
Slow n loading. Apa punya app laaaa. Buatla sesuatu.
Please improve service quality.. cannot be relied upon much needed.. it suck... The worse apps ever.. Do you guys don't have the person that can handle this ke . Shame lah .. Bank lain ada apps, bank hang pun nak buat apps .. buat lah betul betul.. buat kerja dengan kaki ke?
Please do fix your app. I been try to open the app to pay via QR. Its been 2 hours trying to open it. Still fail to do so. Soo emberassing when want to buy something and pay using QR.
We were forced to use this app for our online transactions. But this app caused alot of problem. Server error. Cant connect to the server. Etc. Please Bank Islam don't so unprofessional. Dont cause your customers alot problems. Must I keep on unistalling and then reinstalling again to use your app? People complained but its look as if there is still no improvement. The customers still have had difficulties to use this app. So frustrated
This bank app is by far the worst. It's very slow to load, at least 2 mins at the loading screen. I am not exaggerating! Crashes all the time. Verification details sometimes doesn't appear. Seriously, how does a relatively big bank have such an app? I sincerely hope a major improvement is done soon!
Why won't you take action eventho you have 1.2 ratings? Is user satisfaction not important? This app take too much times to load that makes it harder for any transaction especially after 'go secure' features. If you made an app that is this slow you should just use TAC number. Don't bother request for a rating if your company don't take action at all.
VERY BAD experience. The switching between the acc is so not user-friendly. And now I have a problem to access my company acc because of "invalid credential". I need an urgent transfer and now THIS. If you want to make every transfer more secure by doing this, please make sure the app is good-enough. I hope to see the improvements. Pleasseee...
I cannot access this app as the app unable to connect with the server. I hope this thing can be settle asap.
Terrible! Worst online banking I've ever had. Kasi tutup sajalah app!
The app is soo buggy. It just keep on loading after opening the app. If it didn't stuck loading, it will take a few minutes for it to finish loading and show the login screen. What's the point of having an app if it much more of a hassle to use. By far the most horrible banking app i ever used.
Please improve your user experience. App cannot open and cannot approve any transaction. What is the point of having the app if cannot be open
many times unable to load and log in . bank islam please upgrade your services apps
Everytime nak guna, had to wait flipping long time, the berudu keep spinning infinitely. Please improve BIMB
Not recommended tbh. After the recent update, it logged me off and I had to re-register into the app and it crashed after inputting the security code. Many. Times. There's also instances where it kept having issues even before this. And here I thought the octopus app is bad, but this is next level of terrible.
Dah uninstall, lepas tu install balik but still tak boleh bukak pun apps. Bad services.
Sehari semalam dah cuba log in. Asyik loading jaaaaaaa. I dont know when will this apps function well. Always unable to log in. Worst bank apps ever.
very bad experience. after a year uninstalled this app, still no improvement. teruk sangat, please improve lah!!!!!!
The worst app ever..i got the same issue with others..this app became very bad, take time to log in and slow than before..
It's been a week now and the app can't be opened at all. I can't even log in the system. Please fix this issue ASAP
What wrong with your apps recently? After updating the system suddenly i cannot open it at all?!?! Fix it faster please. This issue have not being fixed even after more than 1 week. Dissapointing. It have been very convenient to use it past few years but not anymore. I can't even open it now!
An annoying incompetent app. I can't even get to the log in page, it just keeps on uselessly loading for eternity. The most infuriating thing is that every transaction needs GO authorization, so I'm just here unable to pay my student debt for months. If you're going to make it so important at least make it usable at the very least. FIX IT.
To much buffering. Server need to be upgrade to ensure system running smooth. Nak transfer duit pun payah. Kalau server down notify la customer. Bukan duduk diam je. Ni every hour nak try login utk access tp error sama je. Takkan notify pun ego juga.
Terrible. It used to be the most handy app for transactions. Now i can't even get through the login page. What happened BIMB?? Apps are supposed to make online banking easier but this is the other way around. It has been going on for months now eversince the most recent update. Would very much appreciate if your team can find the problem and fix it asap!
Always have bug n need to be updated.so annoying
Why so much problem lately with Bank Islam apps? Can't even authorize payment and error pops APZ_TSN_0001 transaction is expired (when it is not)
Bad and terrible. The most annoying baking app ever. U don't understand how it can be worser than it was already is. The loading takes far too long and then suddenly cannot login anymore. The go secure is not available to approve anything, can't even click and always error.
Can i know how long you are making this app to loading.. I'm waiting for a long time to open this application.. Please make it faster to open or don't have any loading app
Worse experience of all banking app. Please make good old times TAC than using fully method GO app. I can't even launching the app
What is the purpose to force your customers to use unstable application service? It's very hard to open the application and how will it looks for us when we need to pay instant in front of a counter? Is this another type of promoting method for encourage your customers to change bank?
Takes forever to load the Ui, fingerprint login failed most of the time, lots of server errors and incomplete displayed infos. *Using a good phone w high speed data and more than decent urban speed, screen sensor works in every other app enabled fingerprint access. So, IT'S THE APP & SERVER. And....did the switch off on phone,clear cache, reset data, uninstall reinstall stuffs. So..Yeah.
Worse experience with new version apps. Bank islam take very long time to solve the apps problems. Very disappointed 😔
It's been two weeks since the latest update and the same problem hasnt been solved, 'unable to connect to server', unable to log in. The only solution that they can provide is 'please reinstall', 'please use the lastest version' as if we havent done it before. Very disappointing. Would rate a zero if I could.
very incredibly slow ive never seen an app this slow fix it even with good internet connection it keeps lagging and takes forever to load
I am okay with the Apps, it is easy to use and I have no issue of logging into the Apps. The only problem that I encountered is receiving the IAC. I have to request new IAC at least twice everytime when performing online transactions (it took me longer time to complete just a transfer). Please advise. Thanks.
App paling mudah nak pakai... Sometime problem.. Tp masih better than others
Worst banking apps. Changing transaction limit should not take too long to be effective. Lol
Not supposed to be any star. The worst app ever. Not user friendly, not worth having it. I can't even make any transaction via online or the app. If not 'no service' its either 'error' for whatever reason. Worst of all it say session exp. Like what the F!! I just open the thing like few seconds ago. Keep logout for no reason too. It was easier before if I need to pay immediately or for emergency now it take almost a whole day just to make 1 transaction.
Just to login need a lot time of waiting. How to make transaction with this kind of problem. Make thing more complicated
I thought making an app should ease the users, not make it more difficult. Its annoying that every time the app has an issue need to uninstall and reinstall back app or update it, and bimb doesn't send notification on updates of the app or app issue so its really hard to know what's the problem. The website page is much more easier to use compare to the app.
Apps paling slow antara online banking . Please upgrade. Penat nk tnggu loading
I have to give two stars only as for now the transactions that can only be use in the app confirmation to do any transactions online like buying from Shopee and it take a lot of time for user to be able to do that stuff then before that more faster which is using an old way which is receiving the TAC code. It also take a lot of attempts to make the transactions successfully completed. I hope Bank Islam can improve this con/problem as fast as it could. That all from me. Thank you.
Improved a lot but still can improve for better.
Why can't take the screenshot? I tried to take a few screenshots but still can't..
Worse, app loading very slow.. money transfer also late. Sometimes i pay double just because this app very slow
It was easy navigation & functioning really good before, but now just to log in I have to try 3-4 times, then after log in, to do transaction also it keeps on loading until the session expired. Is it safe anymore. Please do something, before I change my banks. Dont ask me to make a report again, just read this & do something quick. Bank should be reliable & secure!!
For the 4th time I'm writing this review until the dev team can fix the bug. So here goes, I got stucked at the loading screen even when I'm connected to the internet. After loading, it goes to the 'good afternoon' page, it was a blank page, no button or whatsoever, got stucked there. Uninstall the app and installed it again, same thing happened. I can conclude this app is non functinal and utterly useless. Step up your game and learn from MAE ;)
Stuck at login page and never got through. Been having the problem for the last 2 months. After the new update, it gets worse. Now, could never use the app, have to use the browser version. In process of transferring all my funds into another bank, because their app dont give me this kind of problem. Thanks.
You guys need to do something about this app. It keeps crashing, no matter how many times reinstall the app. This is one of the most important channel to do transactions, yet it happens to be so lagged, not responsive and keep popping error. Afraid that u r losing customers, sir.
After update the latest version the app doesn't open at all & not supporting. Once the app open, it automatically close it by itself. It's vry difficult to perform any transactions & need to use chrome or desktop. The problem has been continued for more than 3 weeks. Regretting for updating the latest version😒
the survey always have a problem, always be dragging my time, always crashing like everytime i wanna make a payment, what do you guys even doing? by just keep updating the app but the app are stil the same with the old problems? what a waste of time. All of the reviews from the users have been stating the same problem but nothing changed. Do your work properly by fixing the bug and so on. My connection doesn't have a problem but the app are just horrible. Do what you need to do. PLEASE FIX THIS
So far so good. Maybe take a look into the back button function, it's better to not directly logout, just instead go back to the previous screen. Same as most of users, the biometric login doesn't work. And when will the DuitNow will be integrate into the GO app? Much easier to transfer money if it is available.
Although to the internet connection is strong the apps remain weak as usual. It will take at least 15 minutes most of the time use the apps services. Sometimes to even open the apps it will take too much time. Hopefully, this can be resolved quickly as it will waste a lot of time especially for those who were in rush because of their jobs or important matter.
The app was superb but not anymore. The last update really messed this app up. It has been a week or more since it can be accessed. Now, it keeps telling server error every time the app is opened. I don't see any immediate fixed on this one ever since. Very disappointed. I'm giving one star for now.
The worst bank that I have used ever. 1. When open the bank app, it shows loading icon for 2-3 minutes before enter into the next page. 2. Many times when I do online transaction, Go secured does not respond or announce "transaction failed" etc... has always wasted my time & energy to try to uninstall & reinstall then re-login 3. Stupid main page that shows the account balance BIG & BOLD, which make has no sense of privacy at all.
This is the worst banking app I have ever used. Lately it has been almost useless. Takes ages to to work, not to mention the endless moments of frustration when it displays 'high traffic volume', among others. At shop checkout I often keep other customers waiting while waiting for the app to work, if at all . What a shame for a bank. With the all the bad reviews I don't see the problems solved. Please don't keep telling users to clear cache or what not...I am sure they do that all the time.
Update, it is getting worse, I cant access my account at all. When I logged in it just load then straight up logged me out. I cant access my account at all and the "Server Error" keep on popping up. This app should make it easier for me to transfer money etc but now, I have to use the website. This happens after I updated the app.
Since the start of my usage of GO, I realise the loading time has always been very slow. Frequently javing server error or simply an error to connect. Its like, almost all cashiers at my local stores would describe to me anyone who uses the white/red app is a bad choice and the yellow or Blue app, is the right choice. MasyaAllah how can this be persistent for almost half a year now. Im sure you all have your Tech team. If the interface has problems, whatabout the security, is it questionable too
App always hang and I need to always reset the ibanking because for some reason, they keep telling me I got the credentials wrong. Resetting password is also another issue and always in circles. End up with the issue not resolved. Overall disappointed with the app, the website is more or less the same as well. Only a matter of time for me to close my BIMB account.
App is very slow. Most of the time I can't even log into the app as it just keeps on loading for a very long time. Don't tell me to clear cache, clear storage, reinstall bla bla bla. I'VE TRIED AND IT JUST DOESN'T WORK. Very frustrating. This problem has been going on since last year. Seems to me like they didn't want to take initiative to fix the issue.
The apps become useless if you are in need-to-hurry situation. It takes so much time to load the first page before can use the service. A lot of time, its faster to open browser and go to the site compare to using the apps itself. Then, it defeats the purpose of having the apps in the first place.
Why is it that everytime on salary day, I can't open the app? I had to uninstall & install again. It just get annoying because I need to set up again from the start. The app itself is easy too use, so i wish this would be resolved quickly. Edit (3 May): The developer response to my email regarding my issue pretty quickly, even tho I email them late at night... So, kudos. Improve my rating. Still cannot actually give 5 star la cuz still not perfect.
Always problem when open...buffering until forever
The app is slow and always loading and failed to enter. Everytime i want to make transaction, i need to uninstall and reinstall the app. Can you do something about this? It's such a hassle to uninstall and reinstall every single time when i need to do transaction. Update based on reply by admin : I have never experience this problem with other bank app. I don't have to clear cache to enter any other bank app.
Since the new update, opening the apps is impossible. Always gets stuck at the log in page. Have uninstalled and installed so many times, but the issue of being stuck at log in page is still the same. It makes it difficult to use the GO app to make payments or transactions.
Garbage app, keep getting "Server Error, unable to connect". The website was working fine before and now you need the app to approve duitnow transfers. Why fix thing that was not broken? When you are able to actually access your account, navigation within the app is also sluggish and slow. It takes forever to just do a simple transfer. Seriously considering closing my bank islam account and migrate to a better service.
Why the app is so slow? When I opened the app, the loading animation will play like forever. Can't access the app at all. I have already cleared the cache, I have cleared the data, didn't work. I have uninstalled and installed the app again, worked but only the first time login. Next time I want to login this thing happened again. The app used to work properly now what happened? It has been like this since middle of last year. Were there no fix?
I can't log-in to the app using my phone. I have been installing an uninstalling the app for many time but the problem keep on going. I try to log-in the app suddenly close. I tried to many time and i nearly reach to the final step, but its suddenly close. Please solve the problem quickly. Thank you.
Been using this app over a year. While it has it's drawbacks over its competitors, GO is definitely an upgrade over the old system where you need to access your account from your browser. The app's responsiveness is a bit lacking but overall it achieved its basic functionality.
Very poor apps. Once installed, tried to sign in a few times. Each time it says server problem. Finally was able to sign in. But the balance shown is zero which is impossible coz the would definitely ask me to close the account. Tried again later. Same thing. Zero balance. So decided to uninstall. Please look at other banks app especially maybank. It's much more friendlier.
Please do something, it's not easy to log in, sometimes can, at some times cannot. Already done the clear cache step n using mobile network, reinstall a few times n it's still the same. It's very annoying as we need to use apps for higher amount transaction. Why bother update the apps when the previous version is much better??
Always unable to access the system due to server error or unable to connect to server. I have tried almost everything including switching from data to wifi, but still not working. The app is very inconvenient. Please do something about it.
UX is good enough but need some improvement. Eg, the fingerprint approval for duit now. After logged in to the system with finger print must have approval again but of on main menu no need. Wierd isn't it? Overall, the app was good but feels unpolished and inconsistent. Maybe can ask for more budget for app development next time. If development is on the way then can wait to try.
Cannot log in the apps since day 1 after set up. Install and uninstall few times also. Logging in always error "APZ_TSN_0003" came up. Tried both Mykad / IC number with and without dash "-" but still unable to log in. Tried using home secured wifi as well as phone own internet data but not successful - same error code number came up. Not sure how to rate this apps. However , using the same usename, same password for internet banking - works fine and able to perform all transaction needed.
Please fix your apps! I'm getting difficulties to view the accounts. If let say the network is unstable and the apps lost connection, User not able to logout. When I re-login again, looks like I need to wait for another 24 hours!!!! Open account with you wasting my time. Poor apps services, just like BSN.
I've been having issues logging in since 3weeks now, been reinstalling the apps many times but the same problems keep showed up "couldn't connect to the server" "high network trafficking, too many users" bla3. But even up until today, the app wont fix. It was working perfectly fine before the update, now it has become haywire & I can't do cashless transactions no more. Pls fix the app ASAP developer?!
Oh ya guys, about the "unable to connect to server" problem, i think you guys should uninstall the application, and then install again. I think it worked out for me. I'm not sure if it works for you, but can give it a try ☺️. I saw the notice on the website, i think it supposedly to work like that.
It's not really functional. The fingerprint doesn't work and the app keep getting frozed. I kept installed and reinstalled but still the same. Theres a time that it can be use and there's a time that can't. I have to use the old fashion way which is via web page key in manually to log in. Please take note and fix it as internet banking is very important nowadays.
I don't understand. It's so weird, where this time I updated the app. Later, when I logged in, there's noti pop up saying it needs a change in permission setting which I really don't understand what's that permission for. Previously, it mentioned about accessing my location, which I refused to. Then, my app didn't work.
Very very bad app, sorry Bank Islam but you shouldn't make an app if it's not giving convenience to the users. The problem is not even with the interface but the server itself - very long loading time, easily crashed, can't function properly, can't take high traffic, etc. Please fix it, you're losing users' trust!
This time I had to re install the apps. Once installed I am able to go in and used the apps. But after logging out and tried to re enter, I am unable to go in. It seems that the icon save on phone screen is not responding when I touched it. Sorry no screenshot. Already installed and uninstalled several time.
It's a good app but I hope the developer can link the internet banking history and mobile banking history and make it into one single history list. Plus, I cannot download the receipt of transaction I made. Even there is a download button, it's for all transaction. Not details. Just able to screenshot only.. So, whenever I need to do important/formal transaction I need to open internet banking instead of just use the app.
I can forgive if an app is slow, but this app is downright unusable. App takes forever(literally never ending time) to load and would sometimes crash mid transaction. Hopefully there will be a new version of this app that can go toe to toe with competitors.
It's really frustrating that lately it's taking so damn long to load the app.. at first i though it was a problem with my internet connection but all of my friends that are using this app also experience the same thing.. idk what's wrong with the system but please fix it.. it's hard to use cashless payment method if it's always taking so long to load like this..
Latest system makes my bill payments delay because I need to be logged out for some time before I can log in again in another application. Quite a hasle. If it is for safety reasons, I think your team need to figure out other way around. Not everyone have the leisure to make bills payment on separate occasions.
This app is a fail. Not just it takes too long to load every pages, its not even functioning well. I once make a interbank transfer and the status is pending! I tried again using website and it works fine. So i had to call the customer service to report about it and it took almost a week to get refund. Worst experience ever. I should've stick to using website.
Please upgrade or update your system. System lag and work very slowy even with high speed internet. Very difficult to make online transactions. Mine always has system error and i cannot log into my account. It has been continuing for few month already. Getting security code is also a problem as i was always getting late msg.
After reading several previous previews, I personally endured the same problem which is, unable to log in using the apps. Seems like no improvement to curb the problem. Another issue which I noticed is that using the internet banking method, the steps are confusing. Why can't you simplify ways and methods.
This apps stop working since 1week right when we need most! It keeps showing SERVER ERROR no matter I use WiFi or mobile data! Before that, this apps was not "internet friendly" bcoz it only needs high speed mobile data instead of basic data. However,even I used WiFi still not working and only 1@2 times,I can use after waiting more than 10mins loading!! And now, completely not working! I wish I can give zero star to this apps.
After updating the apps, I cannot log in to my account as the server keep saying unable to connect to the server which is very inconvenient. This is not the first time it happens but almost every time when update the apps. It's not ok as the apps should be more better to user after updating not making it worst. Really sad though.
Always unable to access into this apps with error msg appeared as "due to high traffic". I suppose the bank should be happy and expecting the high traffic as the mark of trust from the user. Please fix it.. to be honest, both apps and website version. I have headache with both today, and customer service always unreachable due to the high numbers of call.
Your app is poorly optimised and not efficient to be used. Apps takes more than a minute to open up. It takes extra minutes just to do a simple transaction. Sometimes, it logout without my consent (While using the app). Please improve and see how other competitors have better mobile apps experience. 🙄 I m complaining because I was forced to use this bank because of my scholar and I don't like the experience so far.
After recent update (date of update release 11/11/2022), the app can't be access at all and it been days, days that it shows "Server error" failure even though my data connection is stable and all. Repeating the step to try again doesn't matter because the same error window keep popping and restrict access into this app. Thankfully your website doesn't crash like this tho but still 🙁
"unable to connect to the server" this thing happen so many time. should repair it immediately or just throw this apps. how many times to clear cache as you said but things happen badly i still cannot login and the same message appear "unable to connect to server". trying to uninstall and reinstall but same problem occur. really dissappointed
The app is always unstable. It took too much time to load and sometimes it couldn't open at all. Please fix it. Things that were supposed to be done easily & quickly will turned out to be a complete disaster. I like to go cashless so I need the app to be available easily all the time
Thing is, I had great difficulty to establish whether this is a legit app or not. I only noticed the previous version was no longer functioning and found this Go app in the Play store. Checked in BIMB website and still no mention of this new app superseding the old one. My advise to BIMB is to be more professional when handling digital content. Make an official announcement in the website about any new digital app or way of handling.
Couldn't log in since about a week ago. Got 'unable to connect to server' error. Tried many times on different days. Same problem. Cleared cache, cleared data, same problem. Uninstalled, reinstalled fresh with the latest version, still couldn't log in. Please advise a solution ASAP as I see many other users facing the same problem. I am using Android.
I've been using this app for 2+ year or so, no problem that really concern me before beside some little bug, but after a several update last year this apps is useless, always loading at the start up screen, now i cannot use duitnow transfer, this happen to me when i'm at supermarket queing to pay my groceries but the apps won't load at all, now i have to go to atm machine to withdraw cash, please fix this problem fast!
Its very frustrating, the system always down, the apps always have problem to scan the qr code or even to log in. Recently, when using the visa card to pay, it deducted twice even the transaction is unsuccessful and it not only happened to me but happen to my other family and friends. Please do better to maintain your customer loyalty
Yesterday I installed it in my phone and it performed well. But today it suddenly freezes out and I can't login to my account. Whenever I've already entered the password and proceeded, it shows my account loged out. I tried to uninstall and install it back but it works the same. I tried using the online banking website and it surprised me by telling that I don't have user account. Today is a Sunday and the branches aren't working, so I would have one day without transactions? What a big trouble!
Having problem to access my acc. The app kept loading and giving notification to use web. But when i tried login through web, it says i am already logged in due to the app despite the app already been closed. Tried to go back to the app, i got access denied! Been in constant loop going back and forth. This is very frustrating! The app got worst upon update.
Couldnt open the apps. Delayed all my tasks. New comments: I noticed that the problem occurs when I use wifi. Once I switched to my mobile data the apps works just fine. Wonder why. I hope the developer can look into this issue. Thanks Another new comments: app asked for udpates. After updates needs to re-register. Continue to fail to register after more than 5 attempts (tries in different days and time, install uninstall, restarting phone). Please, can developer do something about it...
As the apps ALWAYS server error, I decided to use the web instead.. Unfortunately, any online transaction i need to approve via this non-functional app too. In the end, I need to opt for another banking account instead. It's time to terminate my account, i guess. What's the point if the online platform can't be used during this digital era.
13/1/23-Endless loading when i opened the app. Might be because the new update, at least around that time. . . 15/1/23-Work okay so far after reinstall it. For others who did not know, the app only work on single device. In my case, I used the app on multiple device before, and just realise it only can use on one device at a time, this maybe for user security too.
After update the apps, worst and the apps is very hasle and time consuming to deal with. Apps keep crashing and always appear "unable to connect" and take time for login. Feel very dissapointed and frustating to us while using this apps. Each time upgrade it still slow and please ensure the apps is easily convience for us to use.
This app starts to get slower and slower. Can't even share receipt to whatsapp for whatever reason. Whenever i try to scan qr code from my gallery, the app restarts itself and sometimes I can't scan my finger print for faster log in. Even if i do get to scan my finger print, it takes ages to load. I dont know why so please fix this app.
I barely can log in. The LOADİNG was always taking forever! When it does logged in, every single click to proceed with different services will take another LONG LOADİNG and most of the time I got kicked out or the time sessions expired before I could complete them! 😔 Please do fix it or I have no option but use another online banking 🙃!
The transition is a bit slow & login with biometric also slow. I wish that the app will improves the swiftness of transition from one page to another & also, i hope it never neglect user's security in all aspects. Keep on improving.
Salam. I faced the problem in log in. After key in the correct User ID, the apps seems crash and instantly back to phone menu. I do refer to the nearest branch and contact center but they could not give a solution to the problem. They always said to have up to date apps n for sure i did update the apps. The branch officer said mybe my phone the old version phone n the storage was full....hellooooo!!! I dont have any problem with my acc as i still can access via browser but cant do in bimb go.
Website is much more stable to use, and more reliable. Now the server is down, and I don't know why. I like using it to do transfers and DuitNow QR, even checking balance often. Please fix this soon. But the SecureGO is inconvenient, I had a crash once and I cannot approve payment. Maintain the SMS codes for the website, unless the transaction is through the app.
I got kicked out from the apps when I try to log in. And ive been trying for many times. I think it's not just me, everyone else also face the same problem. Please fix this. It's troublesome to use the website but that's the only option since this apps does not works well. Thanks
I cant share the pdf of my transaction, i thought it was just a bug, that will be fixed after an updates, already went through 2 updates but still not fixed? There also no sections for troubleshooting or somewhere that let u ask when u have a problem with the app. The app was fine until i cant download my pdf. Its just too inconvenience to people using the app.
Couldn't log in to this app, and apparently there's update available. Tried to update but pending for hours. So I uninstalled the apps, restart my phone and tried to re-install. But until now it's still pending installation. I don't have any problem updating/installing other apps. So now I don't even have the apps, and have to login in web version
Was working fine until one day it just decided to give up on me. I can't access my account It just gives me a loading screen. I thought reinstalling it might help, but nope. Now it just shows me the Get Started page every time. When I click on it, only blank screen is shown.
Very bad. Everytime open the apps, the system will loading and buffering. In one day this happens quite all the time. Problem is transaction above RM200 needs secure confirmation from the apps but the apps cannot be openned. WORST WORST WORST internet banking apps. Please improve otherwise people will not put money in your saving account.
The performance is really bad. It always dissapointed to open the app as almost all the time it was not function. Already reinstall to many times, but it still same after a few days. Please make it the performance as previous. Previously, it was really easy to access this apps.
I have worst experience with this new updated apps. I already update my phone, my phone is still new. Already clear cache. Already switch to mobile data or wifi but i still experiencing loading error and server error. I dont how to give feedback anymore. Already uninstall and install it back but still doesn't solve the problem that i experienced. You guys have to take this seriusly 😌 if you want to make an apps you have to make sure it user friendly and usable. Dont make us frustrated
Unable to open the apps at all after setting up on the phone. Everytime have to install and reinstall. When i use the website, require the GO aunthentication, but cannot open the apps. Keeps on loading and crashing. Before this the apps is more stable. Please fix this fast. Its so hard to do transaction.
Had problem login with fingerprint, developer responded to reenable the Quick Touch and it works now. On another matter, there's a lot of work to be done if they want to compete with other mobile banking apps but for its current iteration, I think it's quite good.
What is wrong with this app? I've been using bank Islam for a year now but only the previous version worked and not the latest one😡 It kept showing server and stuck on loading screen everytime I opened it! I also uninstall and reinstalled it several times but still not working😡👎🏻 what the heck?(edit: Now it became extremely slow😡 why?! So annoying!!)
Lagging. Takes too long to even open the apps. Even if it's not peak hour or date or whatever. Biometric fingerprint doesn't usually available. An app is supposed to be convenient and efficient. You lack both.
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME! A month & counting, no progressive updates from developer! I've tried everything you asked for, reinstall the apps but nothing works. Quite a shame, overall quite friendly but not really reliable as to date. Please remove the function of verification via Go if you're not addressing this problem yet. Really wish this can be fix ASAP.
What happen? After logged in, always error pop out.. I've been cleared all the cache many times, uninstall everything and start again.. Yet the issue still happening. This is the worst banking apps ever.. Please get your technical team fix this for the convenience of other customer. You should hire a better apps developer team!
The app is not useful at all as it always crashes or keep loading for a long time. The developer is keep stating that they're improving the app but there's no improvement till now. We as a user can't use the app to do any kind of transaction during emergency time also.
I cannot even open the app. I uninstalled and reinstalled multiple time but it's all the same. I cannot open the app. It keeps loading. I cannot do fund transfers because I am told to approve the transaction on the app, but I cannot open the app. This happened too many times. Do something about the app. Or give us an option for the IAC when we want to do fund transfers
The time taken to load the app was too long and its very inconvinient when I try to make transactions using QRpay. Please improve the user experience as it is used by so many people. Or just try to make a whole different app that's better in every way. Looking foward to that.
Copy & paste function is not available. This is one of the most important features need to be added. The UI/UX design also got problem ; the contrast etc. pls look back at the basic principles of design.
Updated the apps few weeks back and now am not able to screenshot my transaction anymore. I get that we can share it, but if I forgot then there's literally no way to just get them anymore from the app. I need to open in browser and screenshot from there. So much work to do and very annoying.
I wanted to fund transfer to another account. But at the very last page, the app doesn't cross check and display the official name of the recipient account? It simply trusts the recipient's name I put whilst trasnferring? It's terribly unreliable and unsafe. Unproffessional and unbelievable.
Ive been using this app for like half a year or so. Everything was fine until last two days, it required an update so i did and suddenly the app started to take a longer time to respond and open. Not only that, after the loading, it crashed. I feel so mad about this because we already in an era where qr code banking is a must but an app which must fulfill the needs does not function well. Im disappointed.
Worst app ever. Its been 2 months i've tried to access the app but connection server error has been appearing. Please get ur server fixed. It is not user friendly at all. I have to keep on going to the bank to do certain transaction which this was suppose to be made on online instead.
It's been more than a month i still could not login into the app even though after i had uninstall and install it back repetitively. The app keeps on showing error all the time which makes it difficult for me to go cashless. Please fix this as soon possible.
Worst banking app ever. Just opening the app your greeted with loading screen with an infinite loading time. After that when you try login your account you will have to wait again with the loading screen. Your lucky if you even manage to log in even twice a day without any problem. The app is slow when just about to do transaction, QR payment ot changing the settings. Reinstall and clearing the cache is obviously not working. So overall worst banking app ever.
Stuck at loading screen, clear cache then ok for a bit but then stuck again. Why do i need to clear cashe every damn time? DuitNow qr will need to reset transfer limit everytime clear cache. Duitnow qr camera is distorted as if the camera is squeezed. Qr detection is garbage, the scanner will show error message when im not even scanning anything, clicking OK on errror pop up will pop up another failed to scan error message. I only use this app to transfer with duitnow and I cant even do that
Worst experience ever. This is my first time downloading this app. I can't log into the app. The app will turn off or kick me out the app after i try to submit my password.. I tried updating my phone and somehow it worked, I can enter the app, but another problem emerge😅. When I use qr code, it says that i dont have any bank account even though i have one. It even suggested me to register my bank account.
So tired.. the apps keep crashing and it's currently unavailable. When they first release the apps, there's minor problem and it's inconvenient to transfer money but the issue is fixed now. But then now the apps keep crashing and I'm a disappointed user
Cant even log in to the app after last update. Keep saying unable to sync cant connect lah apa lah. Very bad. Such a shame because the app itself is good enough. Just the recent unable to log in stuff so if cannot lon in then what use is an app? I see everyone also struggling with this issue not just me. Fix before i change to another bank
Problem after updating the Apps. Before, i'm not having any problem with the app, but yesterday, after updating the apps, pop up 'unable to connect the server' showing up. No matter how frequent i turn off & restart my handphone, it is still the same. It's getting annoying as i need to make money transaction asap. Preferably i don't want to use the website as i want to transfer to other bank immediately. Please....fix this Bank Islam Go.....
I can't even make a proper transaction without the app lagging on the other end. The app used to be good and was easier to login. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app because it said 'unable to connect to server'. I hope this bug will be fixed as soon as possible.
The loading screen took so long. I can't even enter the login page, yet when I tried to login it will took so long to loading results to " We're having bad traffic " pop-up shown multiple times. Very bad app for multi billionaire company, even the beginner devs can do better application than this one.
Whenever I try to open the app, the words 'Unable to connect to server' pops out and I've been disappointed ever since. Why doesn't it work? Well, that's for the team to figure out and for us to wait in anticipation. So it's best if you GO and do it. Get it? GO and do it? No? Ok. Still frustrated with the app tho. 1 star, very bad.
Another hassle. A whole more inconvenient. You think i need more apps in my phone when a browser can do pretty much everything. No instructions how to start and i can't even get past the login page. Give a damned instructions, a simple one so the not so it savvy can do it too.
The worst and stupidest banking app ever. Logging in takes forever and sometimes can't even logged in. Error messages pop up here and there. Super slow make heart boil everytime I use the app. Why bother develop an app when customer can't even have ease of heart using the app. Worst experience. Period!!!
Currently very very annoyed right now. It has been two days! I cant transfer using the app, and if i want to transfer using the web, they ask to get the verification via the app?? U can just ask for tac no! Two days im stuck!!!! Helloooooo i have bills to pay meney to transfer!!! The apps stated "system is currently unavailable, please try later" and proceed to state " the connection is not secured, request cannot be secured" seriously what kind of connection are u referring to???!!!! Fix this
The app gets very buggy starting on November and I'm always stuck at the loading screen (before the login one). I have uninstalled it once and reinstall it again, but still the problem persists. Fix your app Bank Islam if you really want us users to ditch the web version of it. Even the web version I can't get a receipt after any kind of payment
Current update not working. Everytime I enter the apps, a pop up saying server error occured. This has happened since the last update and I have not be able to login using the apps since then. Please fix the current update so that there will be no more inconvenience later.
The apps is too easy to installed and user friendly. In term of security is quite weak. The most bad thing about this app, it's always have unstable connection, i was unable to access it for few days since its failed to connect to server. 🥲🥲
After the update, it took me few minutes to log in. I open other online bank apps and its working fine. So it's not my internet problem. After waiting few minutes to log in, it log out by itself a few seconds after i log in. It's better to log in into their system via chrome or Firefox rather than use their app. It's hard for users to use this app when in hurry. Please fix this issue please ASAP.
This is horrible. I can't access my account. Wanted to make transaction but needed to change transaction limit, that required me to approve the change in the app but I can't even LOGIN. Uninstalled and installed back..high traffic volume pulak. Don't make an app if you can't do decent maintenance.
App always loading after update last week. Stuck at log in page. Dunno wht happen. I uninstalled the app n install back, the problem cannot solved. I've been use this app since last year but this latest update is so unconvinced. The app should be user friendly with high security but this app totally different. Do something please.
This app is useful but I have problem where it cant be open a lot of times. After I open it, it just keep loading. I have to uninstall and install it back everytime this happen. This could probably be the app needing an update but would like dev to prompt it instead of me reinstalling it everytime. Thanks
The systems are really bad , poor & slow. Seriously , slow to access. Please do update/upgrade. Really bad. Even , i can't log in into my own account it keeps loading. Need some improvement for this. Really disappointed. Today , I've topup for my friend my money has been deducted but he haven't received the topup yet , it shows Succesful but NADA. Hope will see changers without clashing. Thank you 😣
Clearing the cache and reinstalling does nothing, I still cannot access the app since the latest update version. And I had no problem with my WiFi connection. Pls revert back to older version if the newer version is not ready.
Everything with this apps or bank seems to be delayed. Fund transfer has been delayed because of weekend as it is IBG, top-up reload has been delayed because of unknown reason. Been waiting like crazy, if I know about this, it must be much faster to just take out the money from the ATM and settle all of my things at once. Installing this to makes life easier, but seems like that's not the case. Very disappointed.
Interface hard to understand. I want to delete my previous fav acc but cant find the button. I want to direct debit into my TH acc. First, I do it on website but restricted and advised I should download GO apps. Try on apps but cant find the page. Hard to navigate. The only easy one is to transfer money. If I want to managed my acc, its hard to done it on apps. Useless
The most buggy app that I had ever encountered. Slow to start, login problem with error "unable to connect to the server". The only reason I had to install this is because the need for verification from the app for fpx payment. PLEASE, just send TAC code to mobile number instead of needing to use this horrible app. New edit : Is the server for this app even up? I kept having issues with "cannot connect to the server". Seriously just get rid of this trash app if so lazy to maintain the app.
1) No way to make transfer to accounts other than favourite account. 2) Furthermore, addition of a favourite account is not possible through the mobile app, there is no relevant selection to authorise the addition even after being directed from the online banking website. Perhaps a more user friendly way to authorise the addition of a fav account is by sending a code to a verified phone number or email address. Please resolve both issues asap as the app is not user friendly at all at this point.
It is so not convenient. Why bother making an apps if I have to go back to website to add fav acc then go back to apps for transfer? The apps should make it able to all acc. And today I tried to make a transaction to my fav acc list but the transaction is pending. Idk. Maybe it is under maintenance or what?? The money already deduct from acc. It just the process is pending. Help me out. Thanks!
Latest update (Jan2022) - I'm having problem on opening the app from the start. It's weird the app ask me to update to the latest version but when I clicked the UPDATE button it jumped to my playstore and it shows no update since I've set it auto-update. Then, I press BACK, the app seems blank and can't use it at all. Please fix this ASAP. This is getting me worried since I have to check my account frequently.
Good for a start, and alhamdulillah finally what I've been waiting for since first I registered for bank islam. Thank you very much to the developers team on doing this. As I've gone through the reviews, the supports and developer are actively communicating back to the users, so that's a star from me. My comments for the interface is, based on my experience, it's better to have that More Options (six dots in the bottom right corner) to be placed alongside the top-up options on the bottom menu.
I never leave a review on Google Play, but this one, I feel obligated to make one. I have to let everyone know that this is the most useless, yet important apps I've ever download in my life! Everytime I need to make a transfer, I need to open this apps for approval. Yet, the apps kept loading endlessly. Thank you for making my life miserable.
We have to reinstall everytime when need to use this app to get the infinite login loading bugs away. This is the worst app for online banking. And no, don't tell us to reinstall or clear cache or any kind of self troubleshoot ever again. Just go fix your bugs already. 🤦🏻‍♀️
Very poor. Really disappointing because couldn't use it when there's an emergency to do the online transaction.. I even can't open the app it's always showing that server error for past few months.. really hoping that you will improve the system asap :⁠-⁠(
The best banking app ever. Why you might ask ? Because even me, myself couldn't get past through the loading screen, even scammers would not even get through this app too, good job, keep everyone out from entering and using the app. Edit : The suggested "Clear Cache" doesn't even help in this case, tq.
I can't see the amount of my savings in the app compared to the website...I can see the amount😭. As a beginner I totally cried a lot that there's no money in it. Then I checked on website...This app aren't user friendly at all. Please fix this😭🙏.As someone who is new to this definitely confusing ad stressful.
I have been experiencing multiple errors and technical issues with your app many times, in almost every transaction I made. Has been happening almost a year plus now. Reading through the reviews by other users, where some had written the same complaints in few year back, it is quite surprising to know that other than admitting the problems and ensuring an improvement to your customer, there is still no positive changes. Do you think this is funny?
What a worse experience using this app. Before it was stable until the recent update makes it super hard to launch app and endless loop of loading time and slow app response. Been thinking to terminate BIMB just for this app is so slow and unresponsive most of the time and I mostly use online banking this is a troublesome for me. So, please fix this app you will lose alot of your customers because of this app alone
Useless... Annoying... Everytime when in urgent need to use this useless apps it will give u hard times. Really useless.
"Rooted device. Can't launch application" What does it means?
every time you want to use, there must be an issue, error traffic too high, or unable to connect to server, app crash end up use browser. The app is getting worse every time it is updated.
Lately I am having a problem with sharing any transaction via WhatsApp. Everytime any transaction, I always click the share button, sent via WhatsApp, transaction statement will be sent with pdf document. Now it fails when I click the share button. There is a statement stating pdf fails to be downloaded. Not sure whether it is my phone settings or the server
I think I saw MANY reviews saying how bad the app is. Especially AFTER pressing UPDATE. Initially it was fine, I like how it's user-friendly. However, the first problem I encounter is I cant use the QR scan by scanning code from gallery. I have to directly scan the code from my friend's phone, or from the shop's counter. THEN, the other day I cant open the app, so it asked me to update. BUT, AFTER UPDATE, it keep saying 'UNABLE TO CONNECT TO SERVER'. Excuse me? App developer? DO YOUR JOB!
This is my 2nd review. Lately the app has been useless. The app does not load. This began after receiving and update. Not sure what ya'll did to ruin the perfectly functioning app. Received an email to clear cache, but to no avail. The problem persists, Please do something.
Apparently, the buggy, hard to load app wasn't enough. Now they made new update to force you transaction by installing this app, supposedly to "make it more secure" yet doesn't even show the display number, making the progress even slower. I'm beyond annoyed. This will be especially an unnecessary burden for those whose in rush to pay things or in urgent
Server lambat gila tak habis2 nak login and loading page tu pun lama, its better if online banking xyah connect to this app, it only hinder the process if this keeps up
It keeps on crashing. Difficult to switch it on when i am in the needs to use it. But its ok since i can do the transcation by web. However, worse come to worse when we need to approve everything via the same apps that always hang. It takes forever for me to transcact a money. Please do something.
Everytime update, become much slower. Did u guys make improvement or decommissioning the apps? Every urgent thing make it slower demnn so hard.
I'm using this app okay so far, but I just want the developers to fix or improve one thing, which is the length of words can be written on "Recipient Reference" and "Other Payment Details" when transferring money. This problem is really putting me at disadvantages as I can only write a few words. I cannot detail any reason or statement to my payees. So, please fix this problem as soon as possible. Yes, I'm running on above Android 7.0, I'm on Android 11. I shouldn't be facing this problem.
This app is really useless. After key in all the id, password, ic & 6 digit tac number, it says "unable to process, please contact the bank. Not user friendly at all. Please don't waste your time to download it. Really useless and waste of time. Call the bank and they also have not resolved the issue instead ask me to use the normal website to login.
This bank app by far is the worst. PLEASE FIX YOUR APP !!! It is so inconvenient. Crashes all the time. And the interface is so not user friendly. Another thing, was asked to update the app then when i did it totally cannot worked stated that the server error.
Very slow and bad service make my payment time so long and loading so long long times. Better than uninstall this app
I dont usually complaint but this time, Im getting fed up with this app!!!!!!!! I can't even log in. I use Samsung S23U, so i dont think there is a problem with my phone nor my connection. I CAN NOT EVEN OPEN THE APPS. There are a series of events that people have to wait for me to figure out my banking apps coz i can not open it so I can not pay. Please fix it as it's getting worse!!!!!!! If there is 0 star, i would give 0
Hi, it's still happening. Since past few months, this buggy app still cannot open or login. Not only app, on website too. I had to use other bank account because of this. Note that: this is not due to poor internet connection. Other mobile banking apps works perfectly, only bank islam face problems. I already clear cache and still the same is happening. Not only me, other users i know are facing the same thing. 😌
To be honest, this new update on november is so disappointed. Can't even get into the app because of the stupid *server error* notification keep appearing. Its so annoying. Now, if I want to get access to online banking I need to go to the website. That's alot of step to go through. Also all verification that need the user approval through the go app seems impossible right now.
People should have the option to transfer money using the web interface and not be forced to download an app just to complete a transaction. It's stupid and tedious. Edit: Just realise I cannot check transaction history. Nothing comes up. Only details of money going out can be seen. No details on money coming in. Shortsighted design. Very idiotic.
Worse banking app ever. Not functioning at all. Can't even appear login page !! (Error 500)
Honestly, i would say this does not deserve a star. Why ? Because how could i rate it when it could not be used at all ? Just like the others, I faced the same issue. " Unable to Connect to Server" right after I installed the new version. The website ? Oh cmmon.. the system always down and it's very inconvenient. Please do something about it.
Bila update app latest, terus tak boleh buka,, loading je mmnjang..
I wanna say that please fix the bug and loading issues, whoever is incharge with this need to update their systems and always heavy on traffic. Took lots of time to just load a single screen, and it's a waste of time.
After installing the new app, it has been so hard to open in because it kept on stuck at the starting. Most of the time shows connection failure, server failed et cetera. So far this is the worst bank app I had ever installed or use.
I cant open after updating the apps..
This app always cannot open, stuck, slow , cannot connect to server. It's so terrible and sucks. Whoever is the developer of this app, please fix it ASAP! I only use this bank because I'm still a student. I will not recommended this app or bank islam to anyone. Their service was so bad. What's the point to update it just for it to turn into slower and worse so ever!
Please la Bank Islam..do something about your GO apps..you want to force people using it, so please make it better!!!!!! If people want to use it but it keeps loading FOREVER!!! And often cant be use becouse YOU EXPERIENCE HIGH AMOUNT OF USER?? JUST SHUT DOWN THE APPS IF YOU DONT HAVE MONEY TO INVEST FOR IT AND MAKE IT BETTER. JUST STICK TO THE WEBSITE. NOW YOU MAKE IT HARD FOR YOUR CUSTOMER TO DO ANY TRANSACTION!! THAT JUST SO STUPID. PLEASE DO SOME CHANGE!!
it was smooth before. however, since Nov 22, it gets into problem. most of the time cannot acess, stuck with the loading logo endlessly. i have emailed the Bank Islam contact center and replied that newer version is available. However, uninstalled and installed the new version, problem still persistent.
Annoying. Request authorize thru apps tapi apps asik problem je -_-
I've been waiting for a day to use the app and it's not working at all STUPIDDDD Can you guys make it better faster!
I have been with bank islam for close to 20 year and always had a pleasant experience. I never had issues with the app before but of late, with your new updates, the app is not opening, lagging at start up and it is irritating when i cannot perform online banking. I have to uninstall, install many times and yet still the same. Please do the needful and ensure your customer satisfaction is not compromised!
I can't login and then when I managed to login, it said system unavailable or error. The transaction takes too long and then it cancels it due to the errors or system unavailable. I tried using browser and then it asked me to confirmed in the GO app but then I CAN'T OPEN THE APP, EVEN WHEN I CAN OPEN IT, THE CONFIRMATION TOOK TOO LONG THAT THE TRANSACTION TIMED OUT. PLEASE IMPROVE OR YOU COULD JUST LET THE CUSTOMERS USE TAC NUMBER INSTEAD OF SECURE VERIFICATION. THANK YOU.
I'm gonna rate 1 star for now. I've been using this apps for years now and I've always loved it. But now i couldn't open the apps as it kept on saying "unable to connect to server". I've tried to reinstall again yet I still faced the same problem. Pls fix this asap!
Everything is actually great until a few weeks ago when i can't open the apps. No response at all. I tried refreshed my phone, closed all other apps I'm using buy nothing. I thought that i need to update the apps but checking the apps at google store, there's no new update. So I don't know what to do. I need to open browser to check my account. Now I need to update the apps. Let's see if I can open or not, the apps after updating it.
Last month I tried opening the app but it just wont open. Today, I tried again and am shocked to see that the app still wont launch. I'm not able to authorize any transaction and has to go to the bank. It's very frustrating and inconvenient.
Unable to conect to server issue. Tried clearing cache. Issue persist. Cleared apps data (without uninstalling) and login again. Issue solved. Although was prompted with 'invalid id' at first. Have a try. Not sure if the issue will come back. Developer pls fix this bug.
I think it's okay... but i really don't like it when they ask you to update & i've updated the app, i couldn't access the app later. Can really make ppl panic since everytime i tried to access the app, app couldn't get through the server. I had to uninstall the app & install it again. I really don't want to re-do it again everytime the app need to be updated. This need to be fix.
The apps is not functioning at all, there's nothing going on if I open the apps, just the pink cakground and that's it. Not even log in, the button for that is nowhere to be seen. Its been like that for weeks, but I still try to uninstall than install it back, still the same. Hope you cam improve the system.
Difficult to access. Loading for long time. Very irritating. If i could rate ZERO STAR, i would
Please improve the app. It takes a long time to open the app, and it takes even longer to make a simple transaction.
Bad. I want to transfer using online banking, has to download n login to apps to approve. When login to apps, its automatically logoff the online banking. And it's goes on an on. Want to transfer by apps, cannot. No account registered. Favourite account already exists in online, but not exists in apps and asked me to add in online. Why la? When tye loops going to end, i don't know and i don't care. Don't wanna use both anymore
Loading until time out. Other bank apps work well and fast, but GO BI apps, very disappointing.
This app does not entitled any star. Worst experienced ever. The website is much better than apps. Problems with go secure is that after you key in digits given, the transaction will not proceed. The app will log out and i had to log in again. So irritating.
Always does not work!. Sometimes it was like forever to wait this app from buffering.
Force us to use this broken app for duit now, never gonna fix anything broken on this app... the rating also so low and did not improve anything... What ur guys problem... Stuck on stone age, never gonna improve anything... Turning blind eye event many comments on this app are negative....
Your GO app is really unreliable. GoSecure frequently hangs, causing me to be unable to complete transactions. Frustrating! The app also takes a really long time to load (5 minutes wait and it is still loading!) Henceforth when I tried logging on on a desktop, the page declined saying I was logged on somewhere else! Bank Islam, your app developer really slacks. For a bank app to be this untrustworthy speaks volume about your institution. Do something right now before you lose more customers!
I cannot login no matter how many times I reinstall the app. It keeps on showing "Unable to process your request. Please try again." over and over. Update: Now on 7 January 2023. The problem still persists despite following the advice. Cleared the cache, uninstall and install the latest version, the same problem "Unable to process your request. Please try again." over and over.
Very frustrated with this app. Already installed and reinstalled many times over but to no avail. Stucked at good morning page. What irritates me more is the way the developer addressed this VERY IMPORTANT issue by just cutting & pasting the same answer all over again. Complainers have done the install/reinstall processes, gave access to location and even called the said support number but problem still persists.....PLEASE FIX THE PROBLEM ASAP and STOP replying nonsense!!!
very bad app. bank islam needs to do something with this problem. can't even load!! internet banking's suppose to make things easier for user, not harder.
Terrible apps. Cant login after many attempts. The message said done registering but the app keep loading. Clear all cache, restarting phone. But nothing work. Very annoying since online transaction through website also need this app to approve. Please ensure the apps would be better than previous version before launch new update. If cannot be better than previous, just stick at old version or using TAC number. Please do solve this problem as fast as possible!
The worsting apps I been used, the system soooo lag and for the first register I been sign up for half hour just bcz ur system is super lag n cannot recognizer user! Hence, when I use for transfer, the authorisation also lag. Very bad experience! If your apps n system is not mature pls don't launched the apps, just keep for using the website n IT department pls focus on how to gain website security! I even don't want to give a star.
Too long to enter. Too long to load. Cant do transaction. Worthless update.
The load takes forever... Is there anyone can fix this matter? Or would it stay like this forever?
Bad experienced and never try to fix their issue. Too slow to open it.
Worst app ever. The previous still can consider enven there is up and down. I have to instal & uninstall more than 10 times but still unable to open the app. Not sure if the app was created by whom. Might be primary school student I guess
Very bad experience since the last update. I can't open the app since a month though. I thought the developer will handle this professionally and efficiently, but it's just a dream I guess... They don't even bother the 1 star rate😌.. VERY BAD APPLICATION
Apps yg paling banyak masaalah. Tak pernah nak improve comment user. Shame to islamic bank app. Masaalah server lah aper bagai. Menyusahkan user. Lebih baik tukar islamic bank yg lain. Ayat 'WE ARE CONSTANTLY WORKING TO IMPROVE OUR SERVICE .....' give the big hope but the actual 'KELAUT' until now still got problem and nothing improvement done by service provider..... don't know when the problem can be resolved.
I'm always stuck at the loading screen, and it appears a few times when going back and forth throughout the apps, not when just starting it up. I can't do business when everything is slow and stuck.
Just wanted to let the devs know that the app was not able to connect to the BIMB server after the latest update. I tried updating, clearing cache, clearing storage and nothing works. It only worked again after reinstalling the app. I loved the app but it will be even more amazing if the GUI is more fluid, though that's just me being picky. Hopefully the next update is smooth as it's been a recurring issue. Kudos to the devs.
Please fix the app. Sometimes it takes time to load, unable to connect to server but when accessing internet banking through the browser works just fine. A few times I had to reinstall the app just to fix the server error. It annoys me because clearing cache doesn't help at all to reset the connection to server. Why is that a problem? Basically the app becomes completely useless when the error starts popping up, reinstalling is the only option. We use this almost daily now.
Previous version apps are more batter than current apps. After I updated to a new apps the apps seems having a bad issues. 1. It is hard to open, and it takes more time to open. Loading too long. 2. Even though1 managed to log in, when I choose, as an example, to transfer a money, the apps will be loaded again, and it takes a long time to load. 3. Not so friendly like before, because when I would like to check other things inside the apps, the same issue happens. Please make changes

I cannot even pay using online banking due to problem service.
NOT USER FRIENDLY AT ALL!!! Last review, 1 star on December 2022, until today Nov 2024, this apps does not improve much. They include fingerprint to make the access easier, but not easy at all. I can easily access to see ny account with 1 time using fingerprint eith other banking apps, but not with this app. To open each section, it loading for so long. To get approval for transaction also take some time. What's the point moving to 5G era, but your app still slow.
for the past week I couldn't get pass the starting screen of the app and thus i can never access the app anymore. i have checked if there's any update but there were none and my phone meets the app requirement system. the web browser works fine but it is frustrating bc i can't use the app anymore to do instant transfers. fix this issue please this is too absurd
Cannot launch the app. Tried everything and yet the login page never appear, stucked at the front page forever. Read the latest reviews, and the developer keep on telling to update to latest version (3.2.09), which is what everyone already have update to, or use phone with android 9 and above. No solution or whatsover. Very disappointed with how little they care about clients' experience.
The app is so slow, and it will not open at all. I have to uninstall the app and reinstall it every time i want to use the app. After reinstalling, I can only use it once. The second time I try to use it, the same thing happens, and I will have to uninstall again. After reinstalling the app, I can't make any transfers to other banks for the next 12 hours. I feel like closing my account just because of this. This app is not convenient at all. In fact, it is troublesome to the users.
Too many errors occuring from time to time Either not being able to log in, not able to use the QR, and even worse, not even able to open the apps even after waiting for quite some time. Had to uninstall then reinstall the app. It is annoying as you need to enter your data all over again
PLEASE DO SOMETHING TO THE APPS!! after installed the updated version, it is always loading and stuck at the start up n i cant open the apps. Update on 28 oct 2023, i believe there is no improvement that bank islam done to their apps, which is super non friendly user, lagging, need to open and log in several times, i almost forget my password because rarely use it due to the issues.

Useless app !  Most of the time take time to load unable to connect to server. It's really frustrating. I had to reinstall the app when I need to do the transaction. Annoying !!!
i will close my account because if this incompetent app. now that you force to use app to validate any transfer but it does not even connect. i have clear cache, update, uninstall and reinstall before you even try to ask for me to update this app. even tried with wifi and my mobile 5G speed. this is just pure garbage of an app.
25/8/23: Guess I'm not changing my opinion anytime soon. Very, very rarely it was fast. Rest of the time? So slow that I forgot I have to pay for something. Now? I can't even go to the main page, keeps telling me to reinitiate transaction. WT--?? Like I have no life to live, is it, to wait for the app to actually work?
the most stupidest banking app.. it will take forever to load. on top of that if you want to perform duitnow transfer through the browser, you still need to open your go app. it's so annoying and it really makes me angry. i have very stable internet connection. Hey bimb please learn from cimb how to operate an app.
Unable to connect the server? Already update the latest version (as of 7 October 2023). Already uninstall and install again to see if it's working, but still doesn't working. If we need to call the center, every user of this app will end up calling Bank Islam. The problem is this app itself.
Very disappointing experience using bank islam go, it takes forever just to get to the log in screen, not to mention the problem while scanning qr codes and many more.. what's the point of yall taking RM 13 from our bank accounts if you didn't do anything to fix the goddamn app..no one will be furious if there is a slight inconvenience for a short period of time, but this app has been giving people nothing but trouble for quite some time..please step up your IT teams
Why i kept getting error "400 bad request", although i already key in my correct password and id also the tac number. After that error, the app send me msg that i already registered yet unable to to log in. Please resolve this, i already uninstall and reinstall for several time.. Dear BIMB, Again this app really needs improvement. As from all customers that seems to have the same issues, we really need you to solves it fast for us to used it again.
Please please please do stg about the app start up, I can't open the app no matter how many times I tried, and since some transcation require verification from this app it's really frustrating! Why in the world does everything need verification from the app anyway, the duitnow I get, the jompay I get, but why funds transfer too????
Sometimes it's working.... sometimes NOT. It continues to buffer. So unfriendly users. In fact my phone is new, install & uninstall 3 times by now & updated the apps to the latest version. But still the SAME prob reoccurring. Fix you apps pls!
Too slow, the app keep loading and in the end, the session expired just like that. One more thing... it keeps telling us to UPDATE BUT NOTHING'S CHANGED!! STILL THE SAME PROBLEMS OCCUR WHILE USING THE APP!! Please make improvement on the app so that IT WILL BE EASIER FOR US, THE USER OF THE APP!!
Often to unistall and install. Also been waiting for the IAC to be send to my number take years. Requested for so many times still did not received any In case of emergency to do any transaction, this is very much troublesome. Transaction via website also need approval from GO Bimb. How to if I can't even open the apps ?
I will be honest. This app is the worst. The loading takes too long for me to open the app. If its only a minute or two is okay but it takes 5 mintues or even more just to load? I've heard the issue is not new which proves this app is just that bad.
I've already updated to the new version but still couldn't open the app.. I don't know why it cannot connect to the server. I've tried using both wifi and data but still can't open.
Very bad apps.. Always stuck and nothing happened after wait 10 minutes. Causing me very bad experience to transfer money using western Union and PFX with your apps. Very very very bad!!!!
the apps are so bad, clear cache, etc, still unable to open the apps. Online transactions through the website need approval through GO secure, but nothing can be approved since the apps only trying to load the entire time
Took super long to open the apps. Most of the time i gave up. Would rather transfer all my money to other banks, easier when i need to do duitnow payment at the store. Im super close to stop using this app.
I mean i understand that many people are using this app, but you have to accommodate good service to them. Make frequent maintenance, if u already did u have to make it even more frequent. Please people are just trying to get their transactions through and if u are wishing to keep them as customers, please improve.
Frequently got problem to share the transaction receipt. There are 2 ways to share receipt in GO apps .... thru (menu) history mobile transaction or thru individual account transaction history. Both got blank receipt. My phone OS is Android version 13. GO apps version 3.2.09.
The app was very very veryyyyyy slowwwwww!!!!!! Couldn't make any transactions with this app. I am beyond disappointed. Edit: after the recent update, there's no more slow loading so i think they deseve more star
i want to carry out fpx transaction. so i need to use go app to approve the transaction. and goes on loading till the last 120s of the transaction. and when i got at the login page press go secure to approve the transaction. it repeatly tell me the transaction has expired, when i still have 120s. i did a few more time with the same result till transaction have really expired. ok i give another go, i reinstall the app, reregistered it for 3 more time to do the fpx and it still waste my time
From bad to worse. It was already laggy and slow before. Since the update, takes close to forever to load(my internet is running at 500mbps) . And the interface is very buggy. I can't do any transactions just an endless loop of returning to the home screen. I end up using chrome or my PC for any online transactions. Please this app really needs a major update & revamp. At a time when most things are online you might loose more customers bcoz other app(bank) are better
If there is an option to give 0 star, damn sure I'd give it without hesitation. Every time updates coming this app has become much much worse than before. Please fix your app and your server so we can log in without issue. Fix the damn issue asap or else we will port to another bank.
Half an hour loading to open the apps. Very very very bad apps for such a big finance company. Please let us used the browser instead of this app.. I repeat.. Very.. Very....very very.. Bad and junk apps.
I hate this app ever.... From September until the end of October, this app can't perform well even i have updated it... I can't do anything to my money in the bank. Already made some reports via email and call centre for this issue. Seem like no action from them.
Not intuitive to use. I cancelled my transfer settings and press OK on the dialog option, nothing happened, not even to the homepage. I tap on back button and the app not responding at all. Can't even find ASNB account summary or related (not transaction) but the bank have that service, really not good. Edit: No error, I wrote "Nothing happened" means I got any feedback from that? No, you didn't code any error message. That's even worst.
Unable to login,Already clear and uninstall the app.Still get the same error. There is no more,Go secure for approve transaction purpose.It is very dangerous since no safety in online transaction. YES,this is the latest version of app.
Worst app ever exist! Very slow and u need to activate go secure even for small amount transfer. Waste of time!! Once lag, it's going to lag forever.. in the end, need to uninstall and install it again. No improvement despite people giving reviews. Don't bother to create an app if it's only cause trouble every time u need to use it!!
My rating for this app has plummeted significantly lately among financial apps that I've used. Worst experience and seems buggy, it hangs frequently and randomly unresponsive, not able to connect, etc. Not easy for online payment. Getting tired of all sorts of issue for a financial apps from a Bank. Really needs to buck up and hope security is no compromised though!
Greetings to whom it might concern. You are a bank institution. There supposedly should not be any crashes, trouble opening, and unable to connect to the server every time. Please do something about this. I am so tired of having to close and open the app every time I wanted to do transactions and approvals. Worst, re-installing for dozens of times. Thus, I had trouble making simple payments. I hope to actually use your banking app smoothly. I look foward to see some improvements.
I have no words for how much I hate this app. Recently updated, now my transfer limit can't be changed on the app. It's a different limit from the mobile site, and it's a ridiculously low limit that I can't do anything with. Uninstalling and reinstalling for the umpteenth time and hope (yet again) that this will fix the problem.
Im so proud of bank islam. Most of the time this app cannot work, always loading screen and server error. However, rather than solving this issue you guys have a great idea by making transactions approval using the go app. So if we successfully log into the portal using web browser, we still need to open the app which is 99% does not work. What a fantastic idea! Btw, stop using AI to reply all reviews. Clearing cache wil not solve anything for this garbage system
Please upgrade your apps. Tells me to update, after updating the app, it says cannot connect to the server. Need to uninstall and re-install. Tired of doing the same thing all over again...if i can give u zero star, i would. Worst banking app ever. I don't know how many times already i uninstall and reinstall your app. Don't tell me about phone spec, never encountered this problem on any other banking app. 😤
Worst ever online banking app I've ever experienced. After having to install, uninstall and reinstall, it still failed to function. Doesn't even deserve 1-star. Please buck up!! and emulate other banks' secure app that have been proven to perform, no need to reinvent the wheel, just get it sorted out before imposing on customers to use such app for our online banking transactions.
App not responsive to touch input on landing/login page. Uninstalled and reinstalled still unresponsive, cannot tap 'get started'. Hope can fix soon.
Actually not bad if you compare with other bank software. User friendly UI, Easy to use, just abit slow sometimes. Other all good for me.
After update, cannot connect to the server. Need to uninstall and install it again. Loading time too long when need to do secure pay, untill timeout. Not much improvement compare to other internet banking apps after a year from my last reviewed.
I can see this app is improving. My only complaint is that it would be nice if this app would let guest user login using the app that already has a registered user ID. Sometimes, I'm helping my mom doing online transactions when I was at hostel, so it was troublesome to deregistered my Go bank account just to use Go secure using my mom Go bank account.
the app just updated and now i can't even make it to the login screen because of "server error". it's a pain and i need to use the app for online and cashless transactions, do fix this problem ASAP
too many bugs,slow apps eventhough signal at the area in good condition, need to improve on the apps efficiency,unable to screenshot as a evidence while performing any transaction.
Slow loading apps. Very, very, very, slow loading apps. Not that user friendly. Always had trouble using this apps.
Asked me to update employment status when I tried to login through web browser but need to approve via app. Downloaded the app, but need to enable unnecessary permissions. When enabled, server connection error. Head father you, your mother green.
Loading too long. Sometimes not working. Been using for so long but the problem still the same. Never improve. Difficult when trying to pay with qr code cause need to wait for too long.
I tried to transfer money from using website, it refuses and ask me to use this app. But when I install the app and try to transfer, I keep getting error "You are not allowed to perform this monetary transaction for 12 hours".
At account details page, my money are still there but it keep decreasing at home pages. It's frustrating. I can't make transaction. It keeps saying i don't have balance left
Pure connection. Already update handphone to android 10, but still fail to connect, although after using variety of internet line.
Notice that there is improvement on the application, especially it is much faster than before, which makes QR payment is possible. Keep up the good work.
The newer version app has improved a lot. No more lagging. Easy to log in. Online transfer has been easy. A+ for team effort
Unable to login after newly installed in new phone. Keeps saying connection to server is lost. Please fix. Thank you.
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE fix your app sometimes it will suddenly became error and i need to reinstall it REINSTALL ITT !!! IT'S SO FRUSTRATING !!! BECAUSE I USED THIS APP FOR MY DAILY WHEN I REINSTALL IT AGAIN I NEED TO WAIT 24 HOURS TO DO THE TRANSACTION (24 HOURS 24 HOURS) YOU THINK I HAVE TIME TO WAITTTT. I already read someone chat and i read your reply . You said you already fixed it. But you lying the problem are still not fixed .
Edit Again: Alhamdulillah the app nowadays is usable enough. They get rid of the useless feature that caused the app unusable in the previous version
Now it's unusable. Keep giving me error code 500 (APZ_TSN_500). I did everything I could, reinstall, clear cache and data. Only work for a brief moment after I reinstall / clear data and it doesn't work after I close and try to open the app. For some reason, it works perfectly on my friends phone.
Every single time when I want to use go app , it crashed . Why can't you just like before ? Sending TAC through SMS , it's a lot more easier and after using GO app everything when really bad .
Hi again its me your customer. Recently I try to make a few purchases from tiktok shop but after the first purchase, the system started to go crazy and it can't even able to process my purchase anymore. It unfortunately cancelled out my promo payment hence why I'm rating it 1 star. Please kindly fix this issue.
lousy lousy lousy still..updated oct 2023 . Frustrating lately since up-dating this app recently, always unable to connect. Why give us this trouble now? after many years hassle free without un-install and install. Fix this!!! Nothing being done. Stop replying me the same stupid answer like the others.
I want to pay my uni fee, but I can't pay it through online because it's keep loading. I prefer, the old version where we just need to put code from SMS from need permission from aps. Because this app will stuck. I want to pay my uni fee!!!!
Sorry to say. Very bad and bad system ever. After update the latest one I cannot access my online banking. Always lagging all the time even though using wifi. Waste time waiting & drag my time also.
The apps took tooooo long to open since the update. It hinder all my transfer since it need go secure and the page won't open even the homepage. Please fix it asap
Worst bank app service ever. Low maintenance and really annoying to handle such simple tasks. Buffer all the time and not even a message to inform in the app have problems to be fixed.
Apps Loading time during peak and non peak hours are terrible. If other banks's apps can be efficient in terms of loading time and etc, bank islam should make initiatives to develop an app that is on par with other apps. Show some class 😮‍💨
Your notification was so bad. No information regarding the need to upgrade, uninstall and reinstall. Your sense of urgency is so bad that you not allow customer to perform transaction right after installing the app. Instead, you asked for a cooling off 12 hours? Are you running a beta version on BIMB customer? You made 12 hours of misery.
I cleared app cache and data. Tried again. Its working. Thank you. Just that the tag that comes in into the phone only works at the second attempt.. not the first.
Bad experience, and looks like no improvement even though customers rate low. I think you should test your apps thoroughly. It is still the same even you have upgraded the version. Please be serious on improving your customer experience.
I am using this app since last 3 years. This is so frustrating. The App doesn’t work when you need it the most. I think the developers of this App are too lazy to fix the issues. Going to switch to another bank this week. Bye bye Bank Islam.
cannot use during payday week, most of the time hang during transaction,go apps becomes not go apps..the 1st version way much better than current. What a dissapointed experienced!
Its getting worse..i hope you guys can fix this problem..its already a couple of days but i still can't login to the apps..i always update the apps..but it's doesn't seem to be a changes at all..
Truly disappointed! After so many attempt trying to login with password still invalid! We only able to login with same password and username thru website using chrome browser. Please do something with your crash app!
Very slow. Every day I will uninstall and reinstall back. Than need to wait another 12hrs for transfer. Poor app. Why keep continue such services. Very sorry. Very frustrating.
The worst experience ever in all history of Online Banking app. This app is super slow considering how every user's bank account need verification from this app and yet it took forever to load. Such disappointment
The previous version is much better than now. I can't even log in to do my transaction and there's always error that I getting annoyed now 😑. Please fix it quickly
The latest mandatory update is full of bugs. I can't open it well especially when I need to transfer my money. The previous version is way better.
Please make an improvement to your apps, I'm very frustrated and annoyed each time to make any payments because this apps keep take a long time on loading page before going to login page. Please Bank Islam, do better.
The apps is not workable, lagging and not able to log in all the times, resulting in broken dateline and promises( so not islamic at all). Pls pls do something or do we need to report to PMX as well. It has improved and i m satisfied now
After updating still no improvement. After one transaction succsess, next transaction always failed. Always need to log out and delete cache, then can do the transaction. Becoming worst every year.
Can't login, at first didn't approved access, then as it is compulsory, allowed the access, but get error "Unable to connect to the server" Off, clear cached, still can't get through
i can't log in Go By Bank Islam (it said Invalid Credential) eventhough i updated to the latest version and my device is not old version, i told to the email (contact centre) and no response at all, please fix it ASAP, i need to use the app
Just recently update the app, and now i can't even open it😑 it says can't connect to server. Edited: thank you Bank Islam. I follow ur instruction. I delete my app and install it again. It worked
One of the worst app that I ever downloaded. I used to pay via fpx online but after the new update, I need to get permission from this Go app and sometimes it doesn't even work and after the latest update I can't pay to purchase something online💆‍♂️
Very inconvenient. Unstable and non worked app. Cant even open the app and just keep loading. I want to give negative star for this useless thing. Rework this disappointing thing.
Cannot access Tabung Haji even with latest update. App condition somehow as if it's an app made by a guy who just build their first app. It's bank app so with current performance, it's a disappointment.
Told me to use the app instead of website. But the app cannot even open. So how can I transfer and stuff. So disappointed especially during emergency...
Why does it keep buffering? I'm unable to make any purchases. Help please Latest: I've already updated it. Still the same, is it need a very good internet connection?
Please I'm begging you please update and fix the system..its been down with server error for weeks and this is not the 1st time. Sometimes it takes hours just to load -whattt??
Hi there, what has happened to this app, I can't log in even i tried many time. Previous version has better version than this new version. Please improve this kind of problem.
Unusable. App will stay on the loading page endlessly. Its been going on for months! Update 02/10/2023: Latest updates makes it even worse. Did you guys hire a bunch monkeys to manage this app? Didn't gave them enough bananas?
apsal app ni slow sgt.. Bi kena lebih improve customer service n satisfaction ni.. 4 app yg lain semua jauh lbh lancar. Once account freezed, and it keep repeating wrong password.. and u have to wait for 12 hours to make a transaction, this is nonsense service.. I'll better move to other banks..
Worst mobile apps ever. It didn't work properly and not even able to open it most of the time especially for Android user.
The app some time not available as before . The loading process take a several times. Some time i got fed up with this app. Please make it smooth like your take it money from us.
for many times, i try and try but still cannot login and of course it happens during the most urgent period. worthless apps!
Previous update was better than current. Dont know if there any maintenance, app and web both take more time loading and lag when enter it. Please make good your system
The app almost always show error, saying gobank experiencing high volume traffic. Very hard to do online transaction which will need to use go secure.
Please upgrade you apps. Very slow. Unable to do transaction especially paying bill etc.. Thinking to migrade to other bank if no action taken to solve the problem
Struggle to access. I had reinstall for 5th time a day. It's very hard to access. Just used website. Please fix the problem. It's make us not happy with this latest version. Actually, time to time, this apps could be easy and friendly to use. Hopefully, please go through for this problem first. This is the major problem from the others. Thank you.
Developer's please improve more on your apps . Always being freak all the time . Waiting too long to log in . Please la find a better or more high intelligence IT artist for your apps like the other bank . Not make user easy but burden them .
4 Oct 2023: Everything goes smoothly for now. Still can improve the UI. Thank you to everyone involved. Up to 4 ⭐
I love the app although they have problem loading quite a lot. I use it mainly because i connect it to the tabung haji. But i cant do it anymore. Why is that?
Transfer all my money to bimb because i lost my Maybank card. Now i cannot do any online transaction due to this app keep on loading till kiamat. Damn very sucks. Why need approval from this app when your system very bad. Nak beli makanan pon cannot pay using qr pay
Seriously this apps is too slow!! I can't perform a simple money transaction due to the apps just loading itself and I waited for a whole 30 minutes just for the apps to open!!! Even tho it's like that it seems like there's no improvement from the developer to upgrade their application performance... seriously a horrible experience for a cashless person like me.
Very bad application. server always down. Error communication with server. Lag too long. Application did not have user-friendly. Any update did not change anything but make it worse. For technical issue, always be late and too long for maintenance. Suggestion: please improve your server, make staff trained very well for apps, do some testing apps before release it. If apps always crash, make sure ask opinions from another.
Srsly, this system must be improved. I am thinking bout changing my service bcs of this. A simple transaction bcome complicated as h*ll. Byk sgt maintanance. Yeah, a system should be frequently maintaned but the frequency of this app being maintance is just too much and sometimes so abrupt .it bother the urgent transaction. Not only that,the application has tons of problem. Slow.
The worst online banking app. It took so long to just open the app. It will just keep on loading I need to wait for a very long time for the app to literally open for me to do my payment. I need to open the app super early if I want to use the app. There's no nice experience for me while using this app. I really hope that your technology/it team could rework or do something to make the app run smoothly. People has been talking about this problem since forever and I can't see any improvements.
If the App fails, at least makes it relinquish hold of the account. Else, one can get stuck not being able to access an account from either web client or mobile, effectively locking one out of his/her own account! Update: Reliability gets worser with every update. Daily transaction limit has mistakenly being changed from the basis of accumulated amount transferred daily to just a single transaction per-day. Might as well just close your account if you rely on mobile banking at this point.
The apps really bad. You want to make every transaction need to be verified by GO. But almost everytime I do a transaction the verification not pop up from GO apps and the GO apps always can't be open due to high volume. It's really really bad!! Please improve your system!
Please upgrade the apps. Loading time to open the apps is unstable. Sometimes it's working fine, sometime it took forever. Making it hard to perform transaction. Especially, when using Go Secure. I am able to receive notification from other apps while the apps loading for Go Secure. I believed it is not my mobile network problem. Please fix the issue. Online banking apps should be seamless as we are practicing cashless transaction for the norm.
This has to be the worst apps for a bank. You cannot even access and the page rotates like drops of blood oozing and oozing. Even using the website, as payment has to be made, when it transfers to the apps, the apps does not respond promptly until you have delayed payment in your waiting list. Unfortunately, has to be cancelled and switch to another bank service. This has to be the worst nightmare for Bank Islam customers. I would rate this apps zero star for incompetence, slow & irresponsive.
Deserves no star. Time is of the essence when it comes to financial transactions, but with this app constantly crashing, it defeats the whole purpose of having an app for financial transaction. Don't introduce an app if it cannot serve it's purpose. What is the point of me having to approve online banking transaction on the go app if the go pp constantly crashes??? No transaction can go through? Just stick to the code being sent to your phone???
Dear admin, please fix your bugs in this app ASAP. The latest update makes everything worse. I can't even open the app, and I can't even transfer online banking at all. If the app isn't gonna get fixed, it's hard for the users to proceed online transaction. I've tried uninstalled the app and reinstall it back but still the same. So pls fix the bug as soon as possible.
Very annoying. It take a longer time to open the apps. After waiting for so long, the server down and unable to access it . Unhelpful and terrible services . Looks like i may have to uninstall it and change to another bank.
This current version apps are very bad than previous. After I updated to new apps, i having a lot problem to login to do transactions. Its take more times to open because it loading too long. Not so friendly like before. Please do something about that, otherwise you will lose so many customer later. Thank you
29th Jan 2022: GO apps keep loading for quite some time. I've updated my password and even try to reinstall it. But still the issue doesn't resolved. I've been calling customer service/support to identify what's the root cause. Can anyone from IT team able to solve it? 26th June 2023: It getting worse. Seriously it getting worse. Loading time, response time after key in password, transferring money as well (during OTP seems faster), now approving via Apps took a lot of time. Really frustrating
Very frequent system hang. Then I will have to uninstall and reinstall back. Pls improve system reliability and stability. Tq 23 June 2023 Still no improvement with the apps. I still have to uninstall and re install every single time I want to access the Go apps. Worse now it says I can only do transaction 12 hours after! 3rd time already. And you can guess when I try to login after 12 hrs, the apps will just flicker forever and I have to again uninstall and reinstall back. Pls revamp the app.
Actually the app don't deserve ay star at all, I can't even log in despite connected to wifi. The system always lagging and crash, even I'm trying to transfer to my own account. The latest instructions want to encourage the user to use GO apps for any transactions but sadly, the GO apps getting worst without trying.
The app has been working fine for a few weeks but now it suddenly keeps saying to the traffic is high, all the time. And i suddenly have a limit for interbank transfers which doesn't make sense. Just please hire a good team to sort out all these issues.
Worst app ever. Does not even start. And it's supposed to be an authticator!???? Please fix this. I cannot do important transactions because of this!!
It takes yearsss to load. I need to approve a transaction and it takes forever to open the apps. Please do something about this.
Very bad apps.. always crash, hang up, missing favorite acc setting, exceed tx limit error, etc etc 😩👎👎👎...prev version much better...I am frustated during every end of the month when you need to pay a lot of thing..but hopeless... I will terminate my bank account soon (fyi, i am acc holder since 1993)...bye bye
Took forever to launch and it is not user friendly. Admin needs to respond to this matter and find better solutions to improve customers' experiences. An app is supposed to make things easy, not the other way round. Worst service ever. I can't believe that the developer doesn't even bother to address the customers' feedbacks on the app/service performance
Loading more than 1 minute!!! Latest update but nothing changed. Still take a long time to open this app. If I need to do any online transaction😌 then need to get approval from this app, its really not help. I literally spend 2 hours sometimes just to make sure I can make online transaction. High traffic and loading whatsoever are not a joke when the online transfer time only 100+ seconds. Please do improve your apps. It supposedly secure and easy to use. Not just secure and unusefull.
The worst banking app ever. Took forever to login, always buffering. Cannot detect fingerprint and keep on error when logged in by password. Things get harder whenever I want to make urgent transaction. PLEASE do something about all this problems. It is inconvenience in so many ways
worst app ever. it took more than 5 hours to get the receipt of transaction. been loggin in and out. installing and uninstalling. still no improvement. please fix. should deserve no star at all. tired of complaining. same excuses all the time. how much time do you still need to fix this app? it takes forever for you to try to fix this thing is it? and still, no changes ???🤷🏻‍♀️
This app is a mess, cant do anything smoothly. Please improve your server. I cant access it 80% of the time. Even online transfer using computer is a hassle because the final authorization is through the app which you cant access most of the time.
I cannot even log in at all. I only have this bank and turns out its the worst. Someone needs to fix this app. The app said the IAC is sending me verification code but i didnt receive anything??? Whenever i wanna do online transaction and it asked me to confirm through GO as the final step, I CANNOT GET THROUGH. ITS SO FRUSTRATING. GETTING ON MY NERVES.
So technically cannot use anymore is it? I need to pay my college fee, and it requires confirmation from this app. How do i even do that, this app hasn't worked for almost a year
Slow and annoying...try to open the apps but it keeps on loading till hours, thus delay the validation process of a payment or transaction.
I can't use it everytime I try I just server error( unable to connect to the server) But other people can I already reinstall the app update my phone it still not working
Trash apps. If you want to force people to use apps for online payment, make sure it works in the first place. Crash, cannot login, taking ages to try 1 transaction. I hasn't managed to complete a single transaction since being forced to use the apps.
Not a good option if you want to use this apps as your main account. It takes forever to load for login. I have uninstall and reinstall again. Still the same problem. Better to have another account which has more user friendly mobile apps like MAE or CIMB. Today 20/9/23 still same problem. These comments mean nothing perhaps.
I usually use mobile browser to make transfer in Bank Islam. But now you put another filter as in to approve transaction in this GO app. It's good on paper, because another security authentication is always good, BUT THIS GO APP IS ALWAYS UNRESPONSIVE. Imagine a simple transfer takes nearly an hour just to be responsive. Shame on you. It's 2023 but this app likes like it was build in 90s. And NO! I will not reach you at the email given. Step up your game or you'll lose many more users like me.
I recently used the Bank Islam Apps, and it left me thoroughly disappointed. The app's slow performance led to frustrating delays, leaving me waiting embarrassingly outside a restaurant. Adding to the frustration, I was informed that I had to wait a staggering 12 hours before I could make a much-needed money transfer. It was an emergency, and the app failed to provide a timely solution. In desperation, I resorted to using the website, which thankfully worked fine
The system experiences delays until it times out, in Islam is sinful to kill people , this app leads people die fast due to stressful using the app. Therefore, it's essential to invest more in bandwidth. Additionally, there was a security flaw in Duitnow that allowed a hacker to empty my account yesterday
Getting worst, cannot open. Please fix it asap. Cannot transfer or doing anything online. Bodoh punya apps. Still same problem after update. Stupid. Ur apps terrible
After update new version, cannot log in..loading too long..waste my time to do any transactions..so disappointed. Please fix this problems.
I've had quite a frustrating experience with this app. Picture this: you're in the process of confirming a purchase, and you're given just one minute to do so. However, the app takes an eternity to load, and when the time finally runs out, all the items in your cart disappear, forcing you to start the search all over again. It's a situation that leaves me truly disappointed, and I believe Bank Islam should take this feedback seriously. What a shame.
Very slow and unresponsive when selecting several features within the app. Looking forward for improvements in the near future. I expect it to be as good as CIMB clicks app
Mandatory but annoying whenever we need it the most. It lags during online transactions and multiple attempts at reinstalling often leads to confusion. The old ways were pretty much better.
Technology is getting more sophisticated. But this application is still outdated. Please.. Make the maybank2u example always up to date
Such a stressful life using this app. Always problem to log in, very slow server, and even I had uninstall and re-install this app almost 10 times. Sometime this app recommend to use internet banking if this app was in high traffic, but same thing happened. Is hard for me almost all the times whenever I want to pay for ptptn, bill, online payment just because of this app. Overall, this app very not helpful at all. Is makes me stress out even more.
If u want us to update for a better version, make sure that this application is not slow and always loading, I'm tired with this apps, newer but slower version, so what the point of updating if all this things the user need to exprience? Please keep maintaining your apps for better version, fix it asap!
Current version not user friendly. Always have an issue when try to log in and take time to load. The apps keep down whenever we try to open. Please help to fix this. Very difficult for a user to use the apps.
Simple, yet full of features. Unfortunately, not 5-star as it's sometimes difficult to access.
I would give 0.5 star only If I can. This app so worse and complicated to use. It's very sensitive about the security maybe and always got some problem, trouble, issue etc and ask us to go to bank, email the bank or call bank to fix it. Other bank is better because it's easy to use unlike this app. Always give us problem even though we use it politely
The previous version is much better than the latest one. The apps even cannot open anymore. Always lag and not responding. I even can't log in the account. This is upset cause i cant make any online transaction and check the bank account details.
Please fix and do something. I don't know what happened here. Every time I use this app, it shows the 'server error' on the screen 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
Unable to open the app. The app keeps loading for 5mins+. Cannot do any online transaction within the app.
When using scan qr function, there is no dot (.) when you want to make payment. So can't make payment if cents is involved.
If its possible, no star at all. Downloaded the apps because cannot continue with the transaction using the website, then the server keep on "unable to connect to server". U want people to use your apps, like PBe MAE, but then the apps is not working. How come? Many people comment already, no action taken meh? Very poor. Better no apps. Just back to the kampung style. Sigh
WORST APP EVER. Taking forever to load. If you still want to use 'ISLAM' as a brand, kindly improve the app to be more efficient and reliable. It is very embarrassing to see 'ISLAM' attached to a poor, terrible, and pathetic app.
Got an update, cant log in,.. reinstalling and after all registering it ask me to wait 12 hour, and when i do i still cant load the log in screen.. The biggest dissapoitment ever.
please do something bank in should be more easier. I tried to open this application for almost one day. it can be open.. can be impatient. It takes too long to open. Too many time to install unistall. On off the phone.. high traffic it's can't be related. Urgent transaction make a worse experience.
your team have make an improvement to the apps, much better and faster,please make it better. good job.
Edited as 28/11/22 : Only can login after new installation, and the same error still occur on the second,third,4th login you name it. APN_TSN_500 please fix that, or you guys seems working on new app ? Wanna to abandon this one really bad arent you? Edited as 7/8/23 : After a years away, decide to try the app back, now i can say its much better and no pop up error no more. But you are a big name companies, problem like this shouldnt take 1 years to be fixed. Change my ratings to 5 stars
After the update, now the application can be open smoothly without any stuttering or loading problem. Thank you developer!
This app request to update new version to open it but only load for so long and can't even open the app. So bad!!
Really bad comparing to last time. Before upgrading the security, using the TAC is just fine because I can proceed with my PC. But now it requires SecureLogin and then the app is lagging as hell + unable to load. What a waste of time
This is why I hate every single of Malaysia Apps, one of it because, too slow, yeah loading too slow, even sometime the app crash or error. How do you even create this app like a crxp? I want transfer or pay and sometimes the app have a problem, please improve your apps, you want a better rating, improve.. Not just replying and said tq for support and any problem pls report blah blah blah.. No, we don't wanna hear that, we just only want you to improve, that's it
One of the worst app ever. Why? Because you cant even open the app. They dont give you TAC number anymore to your mobile. You need to approve it from the app when you want to make the transaction. But how do i approve it if i CANT EVEN OPEN THE APP??? The worst app ever!!
The old version allowed me to make loan payment even it is joint account unlike this version. Need to make payment via web..so much trouble just to pay my housing loan. This new version also does not allow to take screenshot which I think will be much help to me when I make complaint (as attachment). Useless !
I have poor network condition in my area. When i wanna topup using mydigi. Then for the next step to approve transaction , i need to open apps to approve it. During the approval, the app cannot load due to poor network. After that incident, i cant open the apps because it always popup the approval for transaction then always popup error. What do i have to do to make the apps working properly? I have reinstalling the app but the issue is not yet solved.
Worst app ever. Entered the correct login details yet was blocked. To make it worse I cant even reset my password. It keep looping either at the same page or saying cant connect to server. Seriously, the worst app I have ever used. DO NOT INSTALL!!
It took too long to log in after latest update😠😠😠 After update to latest version,still it takes too long to log in even my phone is already operating in version 13
Dont know what is the problem always exceed limit when i want to make a transfer . Worst apps ever. Better dont have to use app.
Very bad, slow and the apps doesn't even open. Dah la urgent nak bayar student fee, apps pulak lambat tak boleh buka. Even dh uninstall and reinstall balik apps pun still tak boleh buka juga. Please fix the apps
Why it always pop out"can't connect to server" it always happens.it wasn't my connection it all about this app. Please fix em'. So annoying me.
So many issues with the apps. Need to install and uninstall so many times. Least favourite banking app.
Hi. Sorry for the review. Actually it is my mistake. After reading carefully, there are two type of app, 1 is GO, another 1 is GO BIZ. I install the GO BIZ and wondering why I cannot login. Turns out it is actually for business account, which I dont have. Then I install the correct one, which is GO, and I can login now and everything working fine. So I edit back my review and give the app 5 star as I'm very satisfied with the app sp far. Sorry again for the confusion.
just shut down the app if you guys can't handle it 🤷🏻 buat app simple simple sudahlah Fix your stupid app, the app always buffers when entering ALL THE TIME I HAVE TO WASTE MY TIME WAITING FOR THIS APP TO OPEN
Not really work during peak hours. As banking application, it should be able to support higher traffic especially during peak hours. It will be good if IT team can improve the apps ability to handle traffic
ISSUES ALL THE TIME, DELAYED IN OPENING THE APP. which is a huge problem when i wanted to make any transactions in store. Will move to other banks after this. Really bad service. Came back to edit my review, still bad. Much worse. I cant look at my transaction history, have to reload many times. When i say many, more than 10times. So yeah, I don't use the app anymore. I transfer all my salary from bank islam to my other bank straightway after receiving them 😤🤌
As usual this apps are never fail to disappoint me. I want to open it but its just freeze. I cannot log in it. The only successsful thing for this unreliable apps just to frust the users with its uses. Even before log in. The this apps is freeze. So as a compliment i congratulate the developers for developing this incompetent apps for the users.
This app can't working since a few months ago. I have try all methods that have been taught, but the problem is still remain unchanged. I'm using Redmi Note 9s which still Android Version 10. So I hope that this issue will be solve as soon as possible. Thank you.
If you all have issues with unable to connect the server, try uninstall and install it. Hope it helps!
i agree with everyone here. Worst app, slow, and hard to make transaction. stop replying with "we're sorry" and start making improvement. for the meanwhile let us just use the web and TAC instead like before. much easier. you want to make it more secure but the main problem is your apps are getting worst and worst. pleasela fix.
Please improve your service bank islam. This apps should be usefull for everyone cause nowadays everything can be manage by using phone. You're one of the best bank i think that i have use but your apps oh god please improve this! Do something!
Very useless and non-reliable application. Always stuck at the starting page. Have to install and reinstall to make it work, then after some time it will fail again. I don't know who Bank Islam appointed as the developer, including their IT team but they definately non competent and failed big time.
Worse ! Very frustrating! When I need to pay for online shopping, it needs to be authorised on the Go Bank Islam app. When I open the app, it takes a long time to load. After I enter the number and do it, even after the screen shows done, it doesn't pay for the items I need at the online shopping apps. Please improve these. When I deactivate my Go Secure and pay for my online shopping, it still wants to be authorised by the Go Bank Islam app. So, please improve this also. Thank you.
Alhamdulillah... GO by Bank Islam has gotten better since its downside recently and provided an improved online app banking experience for its users. It is functioning better than ever. Thank you very much Bank Islam!
The app keeps on loading in the front page, can't even log in. Very inconvenient. Needs to uninstall and install it back for thousand times cuz it keeps on crashing. Very not recommended when needed to use it in rush.
Why is it taking longer and longer to load the apps??? 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ Developer of this apps should fix it. It's inconvenient. Everytime I want to pay QR, I have to wait for hours. Most of the times I have to say sorry to the cashier and I have to waste my car's oil to go to the bank!!! What's the use of online banking if it is unusable???!!!!
Forever causing difficulties when needed. Forever high traffic, forever cannot procees, forever cannot read finger print & forever making me like a fool when need to pay or transfer at counters or shops. When call for report, the only answer u guys can give is still in the process of developing to give better experience. Nowadays, never have i ever had the experience of logging in only once to just to complete an easy task such as checking my balance. Must at least 3-6 tries before successfull
I am getting error unable to connect to server since the latest update. Such issue shouldn't happened for a banking app.
first time using this application, it went smoothly but the next log in, this app asks me to register again, but when I want to register, this app always can't perform, the answer is always given,"400 bad request","unable to connect the server"," high traffic","server error"...this app does not cooperate and cannot be used because it always asks to be registered...this app is not work ￼
Hi, please make the app very convenient because it really not helpful at all. To transfer or make a transaction, the loading are to long like there are no connection. The website version more convenient & fast than this app, even you successful to log in doesn't mean you transaction will make it on time. Don't link the web transaction confirmation to the app right now. Please bank islam I've being your customer since in college & now I'm 30 don't make it useless make it smooth & fast
The app is slow because it needs a strong Internet connection. That's all. Suggestion: 1. Update the UI app to more fresh one following the trend right now (Be U can, why the official app cannot right?) 2. Make a more friendly user UI, not old school one, bold & not interesting UI.
I don't understand why the app is getting worse after each updates. Online transaction can only be done/approve after approving it via app but app keeps on crashing and it said 'need to reinitiate new transaction'. When new transaction was initiate,the same thing occur again. Then it said new transaction can only be done after 12 hours. Kindly improve the app and fixed the bugs as I never encounter this issues with other bank's app.
Please make this app going faster and smoothly. It took me 10 minutes just for entering. Sometimes server busy and not responding ☺️. It is better using official website then the app. Feel too much irritated due to loading. Even after loading some of the transaction is late updated. And sometimes the available balance and current balance is not merge amount making me confused.
the system always slow went i want to used it to pay anything with qr and it keep say no connection but my line or connection are in good condition.
you gotta be kidding me- i've been using bank islam for a while now and tell me, why is there server error keeps happening every time despite i was having a really good internet connection, especially if i want to make IMPORTANT transaction????? i wish i can give zero stars for this app because it gets progressively worse over time and i see no improvements AT ALL for the past few years since i opened the account
Why the apps always out of server? It's kinda annoying when it happen! It's prevent from doing transaction! I hope you can fix it as soon as possible. It's always the connection problem. Why? Hope this will be fix!!!
Apps stuck hang! App still having the same problem. Loading to long, tried uninstall and installed back still facing the same problem year ago today still facing the same problem. What does this company do for improvement actually. Other banks already making it easier for customers but this company still no changes. Shame carrying up big name for bank name.
Very frustrating. Update, uninstall, reinstall, clear cache a few times still not working. Shud change to other bank now
Literally one of the worst banking app to ever exist. Don't even bother downloading. I'm on the latest update and the app seems to be stuck on that annoying "loading" screen whilst I'm on an important affair. It's 2023 and the app still has major performance issue. Not to mention the horrible UI design. Bank Islam needs to fire whoever is in-charge on maintaining this app.
SO SLOW THAT I CANNOT GET ANY PAYMENT DONE WITHIN TIME LIMIT. since they don't give TAC anymore, i have to approve payment through the go app but it takes forever to load the screen. one time i got a 20 minutes time limit to finish a payment. the whole 20 minutes. THE WHOLE 20 MINUTES. THE SCREEN WAS STILL LOADING. PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS IT MAY HAVE DISRUPTED SO MANY OF YOUR USERS' BUSINESS.
The most useless apps in the phone.not a friendly user apps since it's take too much time to open it (always shows high traffic volume while the user's internet connection are good..better upgrade your apps as soon as possible.
What the hell with your apps, it's getting worse day by day, i don't know what type of system that u've been used, it's seem so bad and always not function., Do something with your system, take a look and try at least to improve your system, i thought with apps more easy, but end up it's make me more miserable then before, you guys have to do something about that, try follow like maybank2u, more easy and friendly user..
STUPID APP!!!!!!! everytime server error, loading take a very long time. how to make online transactions if you cannot even go into the first page. it should be name as NO/CANNOT GO APP instead..better changing to other bank.
Please do something with this app. Transection cannot go smoothly. How many time have to uninstall and install back.
Please fix the loading issues on this app, I am restarting this app for 10 times and I still couldn't get through.
Frustrated. Almost every time i want to use the system always down. Please improve it.
Can I know why I use Celcom data(I don't test others brand data) cannot use Go Bank Islam? When I try using wifi, the app smoothly open which have no needed pending a very long time. I try watch yt on 1080p using a data, the speed is okey no slow. Please fix this horrible situation because I was on the hurry to use Go BI but can't open it. If something emergency I cannot rely much on this Go Bi. Other than that, please make bank islam look more user-friendly because it's hard to use.
Almost every time need to delete the app and relogin to access to the app. Pls fix the login problem.
I want to open the app, it takes a long time to load..then I want to transfer money, it loads again..then it is denied.. after that i must to delete the app, then download it again.. open the app, it loads again, then it is denied and I have to wait 12 hours to make the transfer.. the same thing happens over and over again.. please do something & improve your services..
Please USE MAYBANK M2U programmer to make this app better. Really hard to open, even to check my balance. When i want to make transfer, app showing error, but money already transferred. Very frustrated. This is about security & people money. Please making big change for ur banking system. Dont just keeps updating without any different. 0 star to u guys
The new online transaction where it requires this "very well made app" is such a great idea from them as I would need to face the buffering, 200 seconds when there's problem with the app, error 500, reinitiate the transaction and much more :). I had such a blast using this app!!!!:)))))))
Worst app ever. It is supposed to make things easier, but this app makes things harder. Always took a very longggggg time to launch, always high volume of traffic. Wasting so much time waiting this app to launch to make a single transaction.
It says wrong server, wrong connection then I uninstall & install the app again it become worse.. App keep loading.. Please do something..
Please fix this app ASAP, i've been uninstalling and installing this app countless time, everytime wanna use it, I can't even open it. It just keep on loading and doesn't let me ues it. Not only me, some of my friends and family face the same problem.
The most ridiculous bank app I've ever had to use. The thing just keeps loading for eternity on the welcome page! I can't even do online banking with my Bank Islam account because of this! WTH
TAKES TOO LONG TO LOAD. Please take action and fix this app. Making it difficult for users to pay and check the balance. It seems that not once or two users sound about this problem,but your party still does not make reforms and improve the problems faced by all of us.
THE WORST BANKING APPS EVER. This apps doesnt deserve any star at all. Very slow response. This problem has been addressed for so many times but it seems like there are no initiatives at all from the developers. If you dont want to improve your apps then dont bother create one. Will definitely switch to another bank
Need to get started after update. But after key in IAC number, it's loading until forever. Do it 3times but still same, even already received sms said done register go apps. Buying new phone to make sure using latest android version. Still same. Usually open in website. But right now want to have approval in go-secure. So, cannot do any transactions.
What is wrong with this app?! Its getting worse than the older version this is so time consuming. It keeps loading way longer than expected. I cant do my online transaction if this keep going on. Do something about this IT management or whoever in charge for this apps. Because this app is so disappointing.
Before the latest update i like this apps , smooth but after the update can't open the apps ' LOADINGGGGGGGGGGGGGĜGGGGGGGGGGG......plis fix this prob ASAP....TQ THE WORST BANK APPS SYSTEM I'VE EVER SEEN COMPARE TO OTHERS BANK APPS....
This app sucks, before this doesn't have any issue. Now after new updates i can't use it like before. The apps always crash, cannot log in, and now when doing transaction we need to use go secure and it need the apps to works in order to proceed but now the apps it self cannot open, then how i going to proceed with the payment?
Please disable the function which require customers to use this app for making transaction online, it cannot be use at all, especially when there is urgent need to transfer money. People may die somewhere because of this useless apps! I will consider to terminate my bank account if the issue still continue.
Very slow, difficult to open, please upgrade your service like other banks. Now I cant log in due to unable server🤬
App is so slow. Always have problem / Time Out while waiting for GoSecure to authorize fund transfer..
Bad. Everytime also cannot open. Always high volume. I need to uninstall and reinstall. Still cannot open. Lame. Now fully need to use gosecure what so ever, but to open, the apps still loading.
Previous is much better than new version or even worst.I could not do transfer after skip one time and pop up said it can be done after 12hr ??? What??? Bank islam please dont do this , you should be better with growing IT...
I think this is the 10th million times I had to uninstall and reinstall. Almost a year has passed and this still could not be resolved? It was such a nuisance when u have to do an urgent transfer but the gosecure couldn't be accessed as it took forever to load the page!!! Apa ni bank islam? Benda basic masih lagi sangkut?
worst app ever. so slow. always loading. it deserve 0 star. this problem has been happening or so long, was wondering if you ever want to improve this app?
Honestly I have no idea why I even bother still having the app, it is an effort in futility with how slow and the incomprehensible waiting time for it to open. It just like their management just want to be cursed by their users.
Very disappointed with the app. I don't know why I thought having all my money in this account would be useful. I've been trying to order my food online, and I couldn't do it as this app is not even turning on. I can't transfer in even from browsers. Haritu rasa macam dah okay sikit masalah ni, tetiba jadi balik. Tolonglaa be responsible with the app. It freaking holds our money, how should I believe this app if nak log in pon dah macam2 problem. Very embarrassing.
getting worse after the update. even a standard online banking would FORCE its user to open GoApp to authorise EVERY EFING transaction. This certainly causes unnecessary problem since I am the one who manage my family bank acc just from online transaction, totally away from home as a student. It it much easier before, but now, cannot anymore.
The app is worst! Only few times I can use my online banking without any problem, most of the time the server just doesn't seem to work. Nonsense! Please do something about this or else, do not have any apps at all.
I have updated the apps, but it is getting worse. I want to transfer to shopee, but fpx Bank Islam can't be used. Shopee history already stated as cancelled, but in the Bank Islam apps, the transfer is still reinitiated. After that, I can't open the apps because I keep mentioning "reinitiated transfer". Even after uninstall and install again, it still the same and can't be used.
this is the worst online banking app ever. It is always unusable. always under repair & log in takes a long time. I don't know what the problem is. every time I want to use it, I have to uninstall and reinstall it. please fix it. I can't stand it anymore.
It is good enough now. But still sometimes it will be stuck on the loading screen. Hope it can be better soon.
EDITED 25/6/23 : i thought it was getting better. Sadly, the smooth experience only last for 1 week. Now the apps is getting worst and slower than last time. Im planning on changing banking apps. 3 years and still no improvement. Please change your dev team / invest more on user exp.
Really bad experience. Too many times unresponsive, taking a lot of time loading and just now i can't even pay my bills because it has to be approved by unresponsive apps! You need to learn from Maybank or even MBSB, their apps are much better.
It don't work for open the apps n transaction. Please repair your apps!!! Why not allow to click apps this, aq geramm til lah baiki boleh tak?!
Good job, the application is better day by day. Keep improving, hope it'll be as good as it could be.
Already updated,but still have problem. cannot make a payment or transaction by using other apps
Selepas updated makin teruk loading dan over slow. Kenapa system apps bank islam menyusahkan pengguna? New prob APZ_TSN_500 unable to process your request. Still same when to open apps.
This app has been abysmally slow for the past months. It always fail to load past the circling loading animation. Not to mention my uni where i study use bank islam as main channel for financial services. But fortunately my uni has change to new RHB Bank. Please devs, fix your app ASAP. Update to dev : cache clear didnt help. I almost lose money when buying bus ticket using online banking bank islam. I was forced to use the app's Go Secure function yet the app fail to load past circle animation.
Previous version apps are more batter than current apps. After I updated to a new apps the apps seems having a bad issues. 1. It is hard to open, and it takes more time to open. Loading too long. 2. Even though1 managed to log in, when I choose, as an example, to transfer a money, the apps will be loaded again, and it takes a long time to load. 3. Not so friendly like before, because when I would like to check other things inside the apps, the same issue happens. Please make changes
It's faster than other bank's app that I've used. For now. BUT... I can't share the receipt nor can I screenshot them. When I clicked the share button, it's loading forever. It's troublesome.
It doesnt work lately. Infinite load screen, terrible lag. Its a shame becuz i really like the interface. Please keep performance in mind. Your web app works flawlessly, why the mobile app so bad?
The authorization thru the Go apps is really annoying, I only want to spend like rm20 thru fpx but I still need to authorize my transaction using the apps. I understand it will increase the security . But if the apps keep loading forever how can I even buy things online. I need to buy some food for my CAT!! AND THE APP KEEP LOADING FOREVER...MY CAT ARE DYING. WHY ARE YOU MAKING THIS HARDER FOR US 😭😭😭
This app keep getting worse every time I update. The "loading" getting longer whether still log in page or when I want to transfer. PLEASE FIX THIS. Supposedly when it updated, it getting better not otherwise.
I try to reinstall the app because its still in the loop mode for a long time. But after reinstall Ive to wait 12 hour to do duit now transfer. Instead trying to make it easier for us to do online transaction, it make we are keep waiting and harder to do online transaction. Such a nuisance!
Terrible app. Even ady update to version 3.2.10, even ady reinstall many times still cannot use the app.
The new update is really bad. If You want to transfer money, the app needed you to reconfirm in GO app, GO app took forever to load, in the meantime you have 180 seconds to confirm transaction through GO app thats still fail to load. I am really Disappointed. The worst experience ever.
Several problem occurred after recent update. Can't pay anything that need approval from apps and can't open the qr code
Slow connection. Unstable apps. Please improve for better performance. We are going for digital platform so need a better performance and easier for use.
Can not log in in the phone app. Keep loading. Very disappointed!!!!!!!
Poor services. Can't access apps due to high traffic, so need to use browser instead for transactions. Better use browsing rather than download this apps. Kindly test run the apps stability then only launch it.
I can't connect with this app. That's weird after updated. And always wanted update. Weirdo
Previous version apps are more batter than current apps. After I updated to a new apps the apps seems having a bad issues. 1. It is hard to open, and it takes more time to open. Loading too long. 2. Even though I managed to log in, when I choose, as an example, to transfer a money, the apps will be loaded again, and it takes a long time to load. 3. Not so friendly like before, because when I would like to check other things inside the apps, the same issue happens. Please make changes.
very bad after update..everytime and everyday when i'm want to log in... still cannot log in and still everytime traffic issues..it's make me stress.. i like to throw my phone in the river everytime i log in this apps.... very2 stress... every time and everyday its very2 hard to log in... when it's really impportant to use.. but still cannot log in.. very bad apps right now. . after reinstall.. it's still cannot log in.. every minute traffic issue...its not good to use right now.. i hate this..
used to make online transfer from website but now it needs to get approve using the app but the apps is sooo slow. this is why I prefer using website rather than the apps. please fix it, I've been waiting for days and still to transfer my money from bank islam to another bank. don't make people's life hard, it's not good. so many complaints but nothing change.
Issues all the time, you will either face "unable to connect to server" or "high traffic" notice. Even though I have updated to the latest version and even reinstall the apps a few times, there's still no improvement whatsoever. Nonsensical. Update: if the app is only problematic for me, I may understand that I need to clear the cache or change to mobile data. But, when all the user are facing the same problem, it just shows that you have failed to provide a bare minimum for this app.

App becoming worst after the last update rolled out. Seriously slow, lagging, take long time for loading more than a minute, need to clear cache many times just to approve a transaction or get to login interface, and forever loading. Honest talk here, please do improve the apps. thank you
Very bad Apps. After updated, long long time for the loading. Please improve you Apps
Too bad.. took a veeerrrryyyy long time to access lots of hang, hard to trsfr. Bad apps.. need to improve more
Very unreliable apps , very hard to do transaction , i had to transfer all my money to other banks for better transaction procesess
the worst app ever. if your system cannot support the go secure feature, then better delete it. Just use the old tac method. Really wasting my time using this app. Need to go forth between this app and merchant app many time because the transaction cannot pass thru after the go secure step
It took so long to just open the app, keep loading, then after key in the password, need to wait again. Imagine if I use online banking payment, got long que in market, sure I'll get yell from other customers behind me. This is so slow. Bad experience. Needs to improve or I need to open new account bank and choose another bank instead (of course not Bank Islam no more)
I'm just give a single star because the process is too slow. And my money getting lost by itself without I use it. I'm not rich to sacrifice my single cents
Why keep saying to clear cache. How many times clear (lost counted) it still lagging and there's so many comments with same problem . Slow , lagging ,system down & bla.. bla..bla. Don't just respond to customers to convince them only, pls also solve the problem and find solution . Previously this apps not that worst .
can't open after updated the app,updated to the latest version (3 October 2023) still cannot open,android 12
Very slow for every loading pages, I wait for 5 minutes also nothing happen, please take this seriouly.
We know u trying your best to keep our fund save, but please if u guys always hold and updating the app for unreasonably period of time during peak weekends. It's no absolutely contengency plan from your side on how we need to dug our money for payment... Duhh... Maybe all BIMB branch is super high volume right now withdraw thier money manual for each payment.. if u guys not an expert in apps try hired some expert to do it right! It just took obvious.. too obvious... Same things always happen..
Response is slow as hell. While waiting for the loadings that appear everywhere in the app, I drove to Bank Islam (which is 30 minutes from my home) and performed the transaction. When I got home, it was still loading. Bravo to the developer.
Took lots time to make transaction. Sometimes failed to do it. Just loading...
"02-0005 INVALID CREDENTIAL"....I was locked out of my own account because the app always saying my credential is invalid even though it was fine when logged in via web. 🤬 Installed because the website forces to approve transaction via app, but the app says invalid credential. There should be a 'no' option because I hate the app. This app has major issue. 👎 Developer responds the same way as other critics in the review as if it was a bot replying. Google please take action and remove this app.
Worst ever apps. Lagging, loading, unable to ever enter the first page like 24/7. Apps should make life easier, but this is exactly the opposite way. Thanks to this apps, ill will never use Bank Islam again. Time to change to another stable bank.
Latest app version is super slow. Start to wonder if this app hasn't perform any performance test for the latest build. So frustrated. Cant perform txn coz stuck at splash screen when app launch.
Just please bring back the TAC no and no need GO secure for online transactions. It's suck when everything about the transaction need to go through the apps but the apps are so useless n loading. Why do you all doesn't have any backup plan for your customers? It's so annoying!
I think the previous App was better than now. Not only you cannot access the mobile app page, but when you want to make transfer of money, you need to access/get approval from the mobile app which cannot be accessed. How stupid it is....
Please do something, not reliable. Always facing 'non stop loading' when I want to tap for secure tac when transferring money
Very bad apps,very slow, couldnt ss.. too much time taken to be approved, managed.. hopefully you'll improve your system
pleasee repare the app . soo sloww . sometimes when im urgent wanted to transfer it takes so long to login
Cannot launching, sometimes meed to be wait. And the worst moment is when i need to make a transaction on web, they ask to approve by via app and the app cannot be open. So why do we need thiss app meanwhile it cannot be launching??? Please do something. It almost 3 years ive been used this and it still same like BEFORE
The worst bank I dealt with in my life: It doesn't work with my pixel 6, I can't even use my account on the website because ask me give approval on their app and app does not work.. what stupid poor service they doing, the email doesn't work also!! Plus many more other bad things....
Very Terrible. There's always something wrong with the server and traffic. Make it almost impossible for me to make any payment/money transfer. Annoying and took alot of time to recover. Sometimes, can't event get into the home page. Already uninstall and install the newest version but it become worst than i expected. Please make an improvement abt the app.
Very buggy and now i am unable to log in to my account due to it always stuck at the startup stating, "unable to connect to the server". While, some of my friends are able to use it like normal, but the other friends faced the same thing as me. Very slow in repairing it's bug and problem. Overall, it's disappointing to be honest.
After update the latest version, the apps seem having a lot of trouble..unable to do transaction smoothly.. cannot transfer money and taking more time loading and lastly it will logout suddently
I cannot login to approve my transactions from the web!!! Please fix the app!!! No more SMS TAC so your app is VERY important to function, login also not functioning!!! Update: Help was provided after contact and resolved my issue, bumped the rating stars for this
Please revert back the system to the old one. This new GO is a NO-GO. Not a user friendly at all. The apps keeps crashing and I cannot even log in to system properly.
Everytime update mesti bermasalah! Worst app ever!! Unfriendly, hassle and very irritating!! Transaction were all failed... menyusahkan hidup i! its been 3 days and in consecutive of everytime you all update the system!! What are you guys doing?! Takde usaha nak perbaiki masalah ni ke?! Shows your system and management terrible and weak!
Why this apps always problem? Either with wifi or data. Either bug or loading too long time, taking a very long time to open the apps, and many time 'under maintainence'. Already use this apps for more than 3 years. Please go for some improvements for this apps
2 days i cant log in. They say (unable to connect to server. Please fix this. Edit. ( now tabung haji cant open also).
Why this apps on 23rd until 10th every month can be used smoothly, always crash and need to reinstall back and set up all over again.. i have a bills to pay and i thought online banking are really helpfull my time.. but not on BIMB platform.. please fix this, i been using since 2018 until now same problem coming
Bank Islam app dosen't work at all. Everytime log in, it will take forever to load. The only way is to uninstall and re-install the app. Very inconvenient. In this age of online banking bank islam dont seem to be able to solve simple problem like this. Other banks have no issue on their apps. Very basic problems yet Bank Islam can't solve it. Dosent reflect the islamic or the banking status it deserve. Bank Islam customers are mostly B40 based that explains their typical "tidak apa" attitude.
What the function adding qr code scan system if opening the app take like whole hours to open and what the point to even exist if optimise too slow. Where the fund for the project to utilise and bring comfort and better and easy way if it keep failing us the customer. fixed you for sake of god app!
Unable to open at all most of the time, when u need to access account urgently, not a convinience place to save here
Getting worse. I'm using android ver 13. My internet line is 80-140 Mbps. I just bought new handphone. This is a global problem and not an isolated case. So why need any user that complain to contact the mobileapp when improvement has to be made at higher level. Don't be cheapskate and refused to invest for a better app developer
I can't do any transaction as they need an approval through the app..yet i can't even open the app. This is really frustrating. You should be aware that you've been receiving bad reviews the most. Hope you can fix this matter very soon!
I HATE THIS APPS SO MUCH!! I need to uninstall this apps for getting the secure LOL. Again and again. I am tried! PLEASE FIX IT! Learn from BSNsecure PLEASEE!!
Very bad experience. Try to pay for my korban since last night, even tried at 1am. but after filling up details, go bimb took very long time to show relevant screen then says no instruction for payment. Tried several times. Same experience until now. Who will bear cost - spiritual cost if i still cannot pay through bimb? Previous version much3 better.
Typical server problem. Always high volume of traffic. Fix this problem asap. There's lots of people using this app, and still no action taken. Please, fix this problem. Guna app, berpusing. Guna web, pun ikut pusing. Fix asap, or you'll lose customers/users faster than you realize.
I can use the app only once and then it crashed everytime i want to use the app.
The apps is very no responsive. When we urgently need to transfer fund, we cannot access the apps, when we use web browser ,the approval must via GO. How i want to access my money when i can access the apps??? Really disappointed. This never ending story.
The app refuse to open — even after I waited for long. I can't even see the login screen, merely those pink loading blob that irritated me. I'm not one to leave a bad review, but this is getting ridiculous. Judging by others reviews, I'm not the only one. Please fix this, it's hard for me to do stuff when I can't even access my own money.
Now we can't use website to transfer? It's asking me to go app but the app itself not working properly. Showing errors always, waited for so long but still showing like that. Thought it needs update, but no update available. Regret downloading it.
Can't login after receiving no from no phone it say bad request I already update this app but still same problems already update sign in put REQ registered but can't login
Very inconvenient. Couldnt login in the app and it said to use the web version. But when I tried to do a transfer, it said to use the app to approve the payment. I wish there's an easier way to use Bank Islam.
Shittiest bank app in Malaysia. Cannot even open because it is so slow. Ugliest interface too.
very awful apps...lagging and lagging and lagging. I really wonder whether any QC or improvement done for this apps. totally frustrated use. The share button hardly any use whenever we want to share proof of transaction. please do some job!
Everytime I need to use online transactions this apps keep on alert server not available. So then I need to uninstall and then install again. Why this keep happening. Can you create a better functional apps to ease the customer.
I had operating system above 9, but why the app did not function. Everytime I open the app, it stated unable to connect to the server. There so many things I need to pay through this app. Please help me.
This is my first time using this app and it it the worst. I already had problems using it and now i facing the connection problem i have a stable connection but the app said it is untrusted connection. What does it mean?? Please fix it immediately
The worst online banking apps..Not convinience to use because always stuck at front page or loading time took longer whenever want to check balance or make transanction using this apps. Kindly upgrade it..
cant do internal transfer for my investment account and savings account anymore, it says exceed limit. there was no problem before, please fix this, already updated the limit,but still the same
Why when using online banking from web browser quite fast, but thru app can't connect to the login? Using different server or the app's connectivity very bad? Please fix it as some transaction need to go through Go Bank app.
Suck and hard to get access. When require fast transaction in any store it make it headache. From 2016 until now doesnt have much improvement by BIMB. Really disappointed on failure of management team BIMB.
Worst apps ever... Hard to make a transaction due to lag and endless loading.. i thought banking apps supposed to make my life easier.. but when i need to make a transaction through biz page.. i still need an approval of my transaction through these slow apps.. useless..
I dont even know what happening with this app anymore. i cant even open the apps and used it to pay online. It said server error continuously. Everytime i need to pay online i have to open this app and approve the payment but this app didnt work at all. Let me just use TAC if this app have a problem .this is worst.
Worst apps...always loading...I can't use online transfer just because must validate by this apps... in the end still to use old system go to ATM and transfer via machine
It's always says cannot connect to server. I cannot use this app at all. Please improve your app or i should change my bank soon.
Good and improved on the accessibility. Keep going to serve better.
I got error all the time went to sign in... I need to uninstall and install again.. And it will be the same.. The application take more time then last version...
Can't connect to the server, for days. Good job screwing up the fund to develop the apps, BIMB
App is not working at all. It keeps showing the loading icon. Thanks to not working I am unable to approve transfers when using rhe website instead
Always error, dont create app if always be like this,.. need to open website everytime.. From IOS to Android still facing the same problem. Poor technical system
Apps bugs for many time when i used to pay with qr.. Long queue rear me for paying ahhh lukcily can put atleast 1 star if dont i wont rates even 1 star
Still worse after update on latest version. Lag, didnt show account history, qr pun loading, disarankan bertukar ke bank lain
System very slow during login.. sometime need to re-install the app then can use..
App updated. Unable to access service. Bad app. Response from admin also bad. Bank Islam get this sort out
As i using it,this apps become more stable and smooth than before, keep it up 🤗
New version has better than previous version. Good improvement for Bank Islam. Proceed with tagline 'Assuring Trust. Delivering Value'.
Takes forever to load, very slow, please fix the loading time issue
very baddddd. always cannot open. always server error!
Still bad service...slow maintenance...I can't even do anything through website or application
Apps keep stuck before login page. Your apps and server is made up of a potato or what?
The apps enlighten my routine. Its futuristic and fast.
So inconvenience. Lag almost all the time. Please please please improve this app
I rated 1 star in 2019 (deleted) and i can now attest that Go has made so much improvements. Go, you deserve 5 stars.
Easy to use even for beginner with appropriate button function
The apps is always unable to connect to the server
take so much time just to check my balance, it keeps giving server error😌
Straightforward to use and app has been improving over time!
too bad, always need to update, poor servers .
apps yg sgt tidak membantu,nak log in pon susa,x dpt..buffer..pakai chrome ok je log in..tp x guna gak klau pki chrome nk buat approval kne log in apps gk..benda ni da lama x de improvement pon..please la BIMB learn from others bank apps such as HLB very effsien n convenient..
Very disappointed with the apps, apps keep lagging, hanging. It takes too long even to log in and it just keep crashing. Just do something about it. 1/5 star
Not even worth for 1 star. Please do something about the update. As user, we called contact centre, emailed to mobileadmin.. No useful feedback is given... But for dis time, after update, dont uninstall & reinstall back. U will face cooling off for 12 HOURS. ALL TRANSACTIONS CANNOT DO.. So please, increase your patience or change to other bank...
Unable to connect to server. And still the same even already update the apps :(
Why during Im buying foods you decided to be unavailable its hard yk I need the money seriously can you hurry up I need to use the card seriously I couldn't even pay for the food bc of the maintenance
Very bad poor app for banking..need to upgrade like other banking system..not friendly user..dissapointed
Am having trouble downloading mobile transaction receipt, whereby nothing is downloaded.. its blank if share!!!
I cannot open the app since I downloaded the new version. It kept showing the Unable to Connect to Server box everytime I open the app. I have been using it for 2 years and it got its up and down, but this time is the worst. And since everything needed to be aunthenticate using the Go app, I found it very inconvenient and a huge hassle. Please do something about it. Thank you.
Very lousy apps. I think lot of people already acknowledged the issue so i have nothing more to say
Keep crashing and unable to connect to server
Worst apps i had used, always buffering and can not log in ..who's your IT department pic for server ..should change that person ..
Hire someone can fix this apps asapla. Aiyoo. Big company but loading time never improve.
still loading and cannot open after restart phone,reinstall apps,nothing happen and still same
Too slow to open, missed my transaction. Latest app version.
Seriously..just go back using pin number..using this app to confirm every purchase is nightmare..
Hire some better developers. Super slow app, assuming it's actually loading at all
Not so convenience to use for the waiting time. Need to always update.
Hi admin, why I can't do transfer from TH to own bank Islam acct? Error message keeps on pop up no matter how myluch I tried and after reinstalled few times
the longer it takes to open the app.. the slower it gets...it's always loading why ahh??
the worst, tak pernah dapat bukak. selalu server error. please fix this issue
the apps doesnt work even after reinstallation. it got stucked at loading page
Why do i need to verify at GO apps if app itself can't even function properly? I can't pay my semester fee!!!!

Very slow to do online transfer. Hard to get SecureID page
Lagged too many times, despite updates on android. Please do something.
Why take too much time to login! Not easy to access. Very bad apps
Always Hard to Log In especially to approve Go bank Islam. When in hurry to buy or pay using this app always hanging keep on rolling till death...please la update upgrade or do something to easy all your customers...this is year 2023 and a little more time to 2024 we're not living in 1900's...DO SOMETHING TO SOLVE THIS "HEART SICK"

To long buffering. Please do. Something for your apps. Thank you
Lagging issue became worsen after new update installed. Please fix the issue.
samsung S23 Ultra not support this apps. Latest update on 01/10/23.
Im sick of the loading and lagging. How many amount of data you want to open a single app?!
Unable to connect to server..Go version 3.2.10 and android 10.
I don't know why in android cannot use and shows try again server error but with Iphone its working.Please fix this because it's hard to do transaction using bank islam since I have to approve using secure Go

Apps very slow..please do apps fast..very very very disappointed..
Why when i open this app, an error 500 appears. Please solve this issue as soon as possible
The app getting improvements with user-friendly functions.
I actually wanted to give this app five stars, but after seeing the rating which is 1.3...then I decided to give 1 star...in simple words, I want to set the rating to always be 1...AHAHAHAHAH 🤣🤣 poor "bank islam".
After a new update this week it seems even worst than previous, Cant even open always loading
if u cannot give better service then dont forced us to use ur apps..make many people in trouble..please take note with a lot of comment here n there..n pls do improve it
What kind of app that keep getting slower after update. All they can do is say sorry and after a year waiting for improvement, it keep getting worse with heavy traffic and all. WARNING just delete the app and have better life using other bangking app.
Really bad experience with this apps, always hanging..round and round but not appear. Want to do online, ask to use this apps but always fail..
New apps so sucks.. Make me stress to use it.. Waiting so long and still loading...
Hi there. Just want to highlight an issue where whenever I tried to set up a new favourite account, or adjusting any setting in the apps, out of the blue, there will be a pop up saying "No valid session...". And I will be forced to log out. This occur not only once, but a few time that I got so annoyed and irritated. Kindly take a prompt action to fix this tq
To slow...update for nothing...pls upgrade your system...bodo punya apps....menyusahkan user....slow mau mampus...xpayah update la kalau slow...
Could you separate your ATM locations and branch locations because the branch locator is mixed up with ATM locations. I want to search for a branch.
A good initiative. Had been using it for a while and had decent exp. But I can't put myself to give a better rating when the app keeps on crashing after an update. Never have I ever have to uninstall & reinstall an app per update. & don't get me start with the lag. Even when my data is good, the app failed to load. Please make an effort to repair these bugs. Tiring & malfunctioning as well. On a flip side, it feels safe to use. Won't use anymore unless necessary.
New version is horrible terible, loading is too long and doesn't allow to screenshot. Old version is better. Not statified with the current version.
Took long time to load, please fix for most Android device
Useless app, loading to long. During emergency time need to transfer money suddenly unable to open app. Really hope for improvement. I'm thinking of switching to maybank after this. Good bye Go bank islam.
Bad bad bad .please developed the software with better performance .check the cache .possibility how the data been transfered.take care about time processing and multhreathing.the ui is good but the performance out
Take time for loading. Sometimes it took half an hour. I try to log in using chrome to make online transfer but it still require me to use go secure in the apps. 😮‍💨😮‍💨 Please fix your apps. Thank you
Soooo slow to open the app... the loading took so long... very difficult to check my statement bcs it's always got prob. Very bad app.. always have prob and it took me so long to open app especially when I'm in urgent. Really need to be improve!!!!!
Just so terrible & annoying, this is the worst banking app i ever used, now its latest feature introduced verification through the app when you want to make an online transactions, i can't even login the app..everytime i wanna do a transaction, i need to go to nearest atm..so what's the point of this trash app anyway, so useless..
A really bad app. Cannot login. But i cannot do transaction from internet banking. I need to get the secure code from the app, but the app cannot be opened. Maybank is way much better than this. Its a total failure for me. It should have been 0 star from me.
I download this to experience a much better and faster services, but end up got more lagging, more waiting and in the end cant even function properly... Quite disappointed to be honest.. update:imma change the rating to 5* now since it work well. Thanks for your hardwork~
Slow, very bad.. i need to wait for so long, but most of the time it didnt load at all!! Do something....dont launch an app, if it is not ready .. TAP was much more reliable than GO
In-app purchase authorization (GO-secure) crashed continuously despite good internet connectivity. OTP system usually okay (but lagged in sending the code also at some point) but the latter is way laggy and worse.
I don't know whether the apps is useless or it is useless but its uselees either way. Service not available, glitching, loading.. doing online banking but need to approve transaction on apps and yet the apps crashing.. why there is no improvement made despite bunch of complaints
The worst online banking app in Malaysia, no doubt. For 3 days I cannot make any payment due to high traffic, high volume, error and whatsoever. Just imagine if you only have 1 bank that use online banking. You can't make any transfer, can't pay bill, can't do online purchases. Please upgrade your system. Go find new tender, new company to handle the server. I'm sick of it and I'm on the way to change to another bank.
Totally trash and unreliable apps. It look like the bank hire the intern to develop the apps. Always have issue to start the app especially during online payment. Please improve
Always getting high traffic error when payday. There has been no improvement for the past few months to solve the issue. I cant use the apps on payday.
I can't make any payment. the app keep loading. wasting time. fyi the app is updated. WiFi also excellent. the app is the issue. please bring IAC back.
Worst appplication ever. You are making it compulsory for verification via go by bank islam for each transaction but the apps is not functioning most of the time. This is so annoying and cause lots of problem for the user during transaction.
Very disappointing, please improve your app service, as there's now a mandatory to approve any transaction using the app. If the app keep stuck at the loading screen how on earth we cam complete the transaction
I literally just wanted to buy top up but the website ask me to download this before I can proceed with my purchase, trying to login into the app takes so much time that the timer had already been expired and I can't even get past the Bank Islam logo😠, consider switching to another bank that has a better mobile app experience than this app
Is a very rubbish app. Why already so many people complaining about this app and still don't want solve the problem are you just ignore what the things that people complaining at here? The app keep on cannot log in keep on say error and I want to reload e wallet need to go the app to approve it I cannot make it also want to use online pay also also need the app to approve. What for make people difficult if this keep on happening and we cannot make our things done and no any improvement.
Bank Islam can you improve your app it really slow like turtle then i can't even login to my acc because of it keeps loading, do better and find someone that can fix your app. I have been using this app for 2 years and the problem still the same please fix to make it more better
lagging and slow. if we have to use this apps to make an approval of transaction please keep this apps always in good maintenance and friendly useable. been hours waiting and lagging just to make an approval transaction. or please provide for users to choose either approve using TAC or this ridiculous apps. i just want the best for BANK ISLAM
It is veryyyy slow. Oftentime when i wanna authorize any transaction using go by bank islam, i have to do it 4-5 times because it keeps loading. There are times i couldnt proceed with the authorization at all. Please bank islam. Upgrade your app.
I don't know what's wrong with this app,every time I try to login,it don't allow me to do so..I already put the right password,but still it didn't work out..and always lag,hope so it soon will be fix..
Always problem with the internet connection. No matter how many update. Used to be fine with the website. But now can't do any transaction in it anymore without using the app.
After updated more loading! Use website also need to approve on apps! It has been 2 years this apps got problem and still can't solve it! All are SINECURE! It's so annoying! Worseeeee apps ever! Waste time and slowww!
Difficult to use. Internet banking more convenient before. But still need to approved by GO app and delayed internet banking transaction. Not all people have big phone storage just for all kind of apps.
Whenever I'm opening the app the only thing it says unable to connect to the server. Even though I update the app same problem every time. So irritated.
I have to wait so long before i can make transaction. Please improve. Sometimes, i can't even open this apps if i have some emergency transaction. Please improve this apps. Don't make it worse!. Please.
The worst app you can possibly imagine. Please provide a service that you can deliver, if not just cancel it out. Take a verrryyyyyyyy long time to log in, to scan qr. It just DON'T WORK OUT. Please don't say we sorry to hear your problem etc etc. Just get it fixxxxxxed okay. TQ
This app is a way for the bank itself to scam its patrons. With how the bank forces patrons to use this non-functioning app to make any transfers. Its best to just close the account and go to another bank.
I need to approve transaction on the app but it keep getting error 500. Being trying for few days already in hoping it back to normal. Now I'm late to pay for things because of this app. QR also so slow. Hope the team can have a full testing on the app before release to public. Thank you
stupid app. on hari gaji day cannot log in due to high volume traffic. it said for alternative to use the website. but when do the transaction with the website they need the secure code that is sent to the app. so cannot do also. stupid
Don't know how to say,but I'm really disappointed, because of this app, i rather like the old version cause it can access fast and quick, rather than this version, i know the future in this app are improving,but please improve the system also, worst
worst banking apps ever! Keep loading ended up with server error and taking like ages just to do simple onlind transfer. The apps really testing my patience!! Latest update June23: I thought Bank Islam GO improved! But worsen. Keep telling us to clear cache, but nothing good is happening! Please remove requirement to use GO if your apps capability and quality is not yet UP to minimum standard expected! Feeling frustrated as LOYAL client of Bank Islam for yearsssss!
the app becoming more worse than ever.. every transaction more than Rm100 need to approve from this very baaaaaaaaaaaaaadd app, and yet user can't even login.. its keep buffering FOREVER! fix this already.. its been months i've tolerated, clearing cache everytime i need to login.. you've done NOTHING to improve
so bad. took too long to login even when not on payday. maybank2u is much better. how logically could u think that it keep saying high traffic whenever i tried to login while my friends could easily login. i am sure that this is not about phone issue
I dont understand why the apps is slow. I'd rather doing the online banking using google chrome. It is faster compared to the apps itself. I hope Bank Islam will address this issue as soon as possible
No offense, I know it is the goverment orders to use secure2u in mobile apps for verification relating to any online payments but you gotta fix the unstable problems of your mobile apps as soon as possible, guys. It's hindering day to day operations.
It always have an issues such as hard to log in, take very long time when loading and unable to connect with server. I'm sick of this kind of problems. Please fix it.
I tend not to give any star for the apps..... Always stuck at startup and cannot login this apps.... More than a month this issue still status quo.. Not sure what are the action taken by Bank Islam team.....if there is a chance, for sure will transfer all to another bank acc....
Dear team..why i cannot open the app?it keep saying "unable to connect server".i already install and uninstall many time..this is the third day i keep install and uninstall...i notice when have event on that month bank islam apps will be crash every day..please improve your trafic to avoid this kind of situation..this is second time i comment at here..but still no improvement.
I need to make a important transfer right now and the app is not working like it took too much time for loading and it sign out it own. Really really bad experience and so disappointed with this app right now.
App is laggy and full of error. I have uninstalled and reinstalled. But still cannot open the app. It stated that error 500. Please do something! I cannot transfer my money online because the approval need to be done on apps
Always experiencing failed transactions when I start to use this Go App system. I really don't like it. Not convenient to use it. It's better for not using this system. I think I should use other bank.
Frustrating, tried to make a transaction by web because the apps won't stop load and stuck on the welcome page, but then after inputing all the info required still need to approve the web transaction by apps which i can't open hmmmm
Worst apps ever. They keep loading all the time. However, I can smoothly use the other bank apps, so it's not an issue with my internet connection. I had no problems when using Chrome for bank Islam Internet banking
The most irritating online banking app. Now need to approve in bank Islam Go for online transaction, while I cannot even access to the app. Gosh need to do something about it. Always unavailable. So not helpful at all.
How did you managed to mess it up? it was doing fine before. right now its just impossible to even log into the app. loads forever and suddenly system is currently unavailable.
The worst ever apps compared to other competitor banks. Unable to open, keep loading and loading... Once u able to login, keep delayed in receiving the TAC... So many issues...bad customer experience...
Really great to whomever force this app of any transaction. Who's idea would great enough to forcely link any transaction with an app so buggy. Bring back message code! This app is not suitable for older phone!!!
As a customer, I am gonna be very honest. Did you see all the bad reviews here? Everyone of them filed the same complain and it seems you did not take any action for the matter. If that does not ring a bell, let me tell you the problem, your apps are extremely lagging, it frequently jammed which cause my transaction cancelled, I am embarassed when the cashier waiting for me to pay for 30 MINUTES, 30 MINUTES, I'm not even exaggerate, this happens too often. You must fix the problems immidiately.
Very poor apps, even no issue with Internet speed, the apps still lag for a few minutes. Most stressful bcoz need to approve transactions via go secure but apps hang to open
First time login, masuk kan sms FA, error 500 Edit: switch lines & retry. Work like a charm. Edit2: everytime there's new update I have to key in password and set fingerprint setting again, this is stupid and wasting time. Please fired your app vendor!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What can i say. I am a truly frustrated, disappointed user. This apps is way below the normal standard of other online banking apps such as m2u, cimbclicks etc. I would even give 0 star if google allows me to! Update 24/6/2023: This apps is still suxx. No improvement at all. Even worse than before. I would still go for 0 star!
Bad experience. Slow apps just to load the login page. For certain payment, need approval from apps, but this apps stuck. Please invest to improve and overcome the bottleneck especially on the salary day.
Having a nightmare with this app, keeps on circling until the requested times are up. Not once, can't recalled the experience. Truly disaster
This app really make my business even worse. Take a really long time to loading which I need to delay my important transaction just to wait it loading. The server always error. Really hard to go with this app.
This apps was performing from normal to bad . Now going from bad to worse. Please do something. Upgrade it, make it faster and don't forget about improving it's safety features.
The worst online banking app in the history ever made! What kind of degen software developers that you hired huh? I can't even open the app after the update. Takes 9999 years to load! If you can't be sure that this app can performs flawlessly then don't publish at all! Just stick to the website one man! You're losing a lot of customers here trust me! And I'm wasting googolplex of my timea Not recommended at all!
Dear bank islam....just delete this app from Google play. This app exist just to ruin my day and my storage...if it's won't able to function well then there is no reason for it to exist. It's been a decade and this problem seem to be remain unsolved like forever. Thanks for providing stupidest online banking app ever 👍. Just don't wanna harsh but if soft spoken won't so why don't?
Please hire someone that really good in IT. So, your user can using this app easily and more faster like a cheetah. Your apps now is almost being near with useless. PLEASE FIX IT!! FIX IT!! FIX IT!!
I need to APPROVE my transaction with this app, but this app can't even open!! You do realise that people have to do transaction on the web BECAUSE the app DOESN'T WORKK!! Now you want us to use your useless app to approve that transaction?! Who's stupid idea was this??!! Worst banking app I've ever experienced!! Just abolish the app and focus on the web!! The app is an epic FAILURE!!!!!
They always pending my transaction.. my money also successful transfer but when i check in another account, my money still stuck. it happened 2x to me and now i stuck again my transaction! Please improve your system !
I'm out of words. Really. Setiap update membuat app bertambah teruk. I am not even sure whether our complaints are taken into account, it looks like we are replied by the bot. Tak tahu apa solusi tech team Bank Islam untuk masalah berpanjangan mengenai app, bertahun-tahun ini. Menyusahkan keadaan. Transactions perlu approved melalui app, and yet the app itself failed to load at THE VERY BEGINNING OF LAUNCH. Transaksi kami ni jenaka ke, bagi Bank Islam?
This is worst app experienced that I ever had... The loading screen took way too long and sometimes you cant even open the app for the whole day. This have caused me lot of problem
The app is slow even though my internet connection is good because the other apps are okay. I can open them fast but not this app. Thank you Update: Assalamualaikum bank islam. Saya rasa pihak bank islam dah sedia maklum tentang apps online banking yang sangat slow. Ramai cakap benda sama. Saya rasa boleh slowly take action instead of suruh buat aduan kat email etc.
12/07 - I had to install and uninstall it a few times. Not just normal update. Super stress!!! Hari ni nak login tak boleh keluar error 500 APZ_TSN_500. Apa ni Bank Islam, ulang tahun ke 40, servis makin teruk. 14/07 - 2 times transaction failed because of loading time took more than 3 minutes. Bank Islam tolonglah upgrade server.
Buggy, loading... if happen surely need re-install back. Edited: Now the response getting ok. Just my favourite from website not available in apps, need to re-add. Overall ok easy, good & smooth. #keepitup
Previous version more compatible compared for right know. Keep loading and crash. Please⁹x,make iit be an enjoyable apps ro use. Not getting more stress from it
Always problematic to open. Now for the past few days, i continuously getting error to open the app. Trying to uninstall and reinstall. Same problem. Truly useless app.
The apps is super duper lagginggggg!! Sometime after the long wait can login to the system but sometime will just show error message! Clear cache multiple times also not working 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I need to use the apps to do online transactio but can't even open the apps. Loading je memanjang..tekan ape2 keluar blank page..stop depend on the apps if the apps is always crash.
Slow, then suddenly my account have a limit for transferring to other accounts even though it is less than the daily limit set beforehand. Try asking help from support but its useless.
the latest version for bank islam is so disappointed. it make hard to the late version of phone to be install that application especially for the older one . is it the best that you can do for the people who was using ur application ? if this keep happening, it's only make people to choose another bank 😤
Very slow. Please improve your app. After all these years of update, transaction become worsed as you still need to open the apps even using web biz page. Very unprofessional of handling customer complaints. Shameful
Previous version much better than new update. To Developer this app supposed to help user & enhanced ur security not give burden on them. Manager, Sales, Pre-Sales, Marketing & Developer please improved your application before we change to used other services. Thank you.
Before this the app is just okay, but yesterday an error message keeps popping up and wouldn't disappear and I cannot make any transactions using Bank Islam. I have Deleted the app yesterday.
Worst mobile banking app ever, slow and sometimes just does not work. If in an emergency the person would have died waiting for the app to start.
ALWAYS UNABLE TO CONNECT TO THE SERVER / NO FUNCTION Cannot approve the transaction since cannot login into the Go by Bank Islam apps. VERY STUPID apps. NOTORIOUS for crashing. Like always the pegawai bank will only say sorry for inconvenience. The fact is, on customer's part, it is not inconvenience but a difficult hindrance to the transaction. TAKE NOTE BANK ISLAM. DON'T BE BITTER WITH THIS COMMENT BUT GET BETTER!!
I guess it is either the dev team is underpaid or you lots just plain idiot with no brain. Wasted half an hour just to make an instant transfer to another account. I don't wish you guys the dev team success. The Dev team doesn't deserve to be happy or successful in this world due to their "phenomenal" banking app. No improvements since the last 3-4 years. Lazy developers!
This app so problematic, try to login since yesterday and still its loading though I have good internet. I couldn't make any payments. Even CIMB I can login with 512 kbs when I'm run out of data.
too bad when opening his apps, always loading. why is this happening? his service is too bad. It's really hard for me to transfer money to other people because it's hard to open their apps, just load them Please take immediate action.tq
As a student using bank islam is really difficult.Because most off the time this app is not working properly.if we want to top up or transfer the money it's really hard for us. Most of the time this app is not working properly....
Very unfriendly user. Takes a very long time to load. Unexpected time to make a maintenance and everything bad combine in one app
recently using this app is difficult and unpleasant, since it takes too long to open and also frequently not responding. very frustrating since i cant settle my bills and payment as planned.
Suddenly show a server network error and even after reinstall the app, its good for a few hours then the same thing happen again. Fix this thing
The worst ever. Install uninstall for three times. Still cannot open the apps. Better dont have the apps if its can't be open or lagging all the time.
So far the slowest mobile Internet banking app i ever used..still can't open the apps after 10 minutes waiting.. Affect my payment / transfer every month.. Bank islam should have assess again this apps.. Using website is better, but still need secure number from apps..
I'm sorry but please please please hire someone who can really do the jobs right. Why this app always laggy and buggy.. why it keeps reloading... how many times do I have to keep key in the information.. so not user friendly
Worst app ever. Might consider to change to other banks if you don't improve / upgrade your apps. Update on 25/6/23: still cannot use. Don't bother to download this app. USELESS
I was using bank Islam website to transfer but couldnt and the website told me to download the apps. Now i cant even login the apps because there is error popup. The worst apps, service and a waste of time.
Please improved the apps for better experience..regret to use it as my main bank transaction...anything related on online payment so lembap bapak lahh..link with go transactions not sync, pending and transaction will be invalid..did not sure amount transaction were deducted or not..to open apps / using qr paid kena sidai macam hape.bende laa bank apps mcam ni.letihlaa...
I couldn't even open up the apps, such a bummer! I need to do instant transfer, but the apps didn't help at all. Do better with the apps Bank Islam..
I don't know what happened but it seems I can't log in into my account, is it under maintenance? Because it always log out when I'm login. Hard for me to make transaction
Please improve your system. Seriously so stress when people using to play. 1st thing is the GO app. No need actually when we using OTP. Then always system is currently not available. My God seriously so stressed. improve improve improve please🙏🏽
Worst application ever. The application should be more easier but became more harder. Cannot use the application at all. I even cannot pay my bill.
The slowest apps that universe can handle. I think, it is faster to go to the bank, take a number and que at the counter just to know my account balance than waiting this app to load.
The previous one i think much better. The new version i cant even log in, it just keep on loading and loading 🙂 please fix the issue.
Can't open the app for so long. How to transfer my money?? Even when i'm trying to topup my shopee pay, I cant use this bank because I need to open the app to authorize the transaction. Please improve asap 😠
(Edited) Now, the app navigation seems ok for me. So i add 2 star more from my original 1 star review before. Also, for not be able to see my transactions history pains me. So no more star for you for now
VERY VERY BAD!!!! WHY THE SYSTEM IS VERY SLOW UNLIKE MAYBANK. Bfr this, I can buy the ticket without need to download the go bank Islam apps. But today suddenly I must use the app to settle the payment. This app is very bad & please do not trouble us as the bank Islam users with your bad system.
Trash apps, sorry for the harsh word but come on Bank Islam? Already 2021 but still with this kind of apps. Hardly stable to use. People use mobile apps for convenience not to get more headache haiya. Update : 2023 still trash. Both website and mobile apps cannot be used at all. Don't bother using Bank Islam anymore
Update your system properly. What's the use of keep updating but the outcome got worse. Ugh if it's not for my uni i would never use this trashy app. BANK ISLAM PLEASE IMPROVE YOUR SYSTEM. THE PROBLEM HAS ONGOING FOR SO LONG BUT THERE'S NO ACTION TAKEN? WORST BANKING APP EVER
i want to review without giving A star actually. This app always bug . if i uninstall and install back, i have to wait another 12 hours so i can use the transfer method and others . what a problematic app . VERY TROUBLESOME .
Always high volume of traffic. Not ideal for emergency. Loading time takes too long. Need more than 10 minutes just to load up QR.
This app is really terrible. It's always have problems and when you enter the app, it's take too much time to load. Mybank app is better in my opinion.
I can't even open the apps after the update! Worst banking apps ever. It make the transactions more difficult/ almost impossible!!!
I want to online transfer, but due to apps server error, i need to wait until it's okay. No option like TAC or other if something happen like this. Poor apps.
Slowest apps to be honest..Please take your users opinion for better result..We suffer more than anyone everytime we try to make transition,transfer and everything..Please make sure your apps run more smoothly..TQ
Super slow after updates, login, transaction ,then after finish transfer ,it log out ,then try to login again, access denied. Done reinstall. Still problem occur .please check .
Downloaded it for the first time today and all I get is "Server Error: Unable to connect to the server". What a waste of time. Not going to bother trying it later in the future if it can't even function.
Trying to open the apps but got an issues on the server, tried to uninstall it but until today its failed, please resolve this issues ASAP (15/12/22). UNTIL TODAY THIS IS ISSUES IS NOT RESOLVE (02/08/23)
Please bank Islam improve your application. It takes time to open and sometimes there have many errors.. It's easy to use but the loading and errors make me annoyed.
Recevied error message "Reach maximun of user id". After de-listed user and add new user. Please fix this issue. I believe this is only minor issue.
I wanted to do the transaction request from other app, then it asked me to redirect to this app to continue the transaction. But when i opened this app, it suddenly said "please reinitiate the transaction" and the app stuck with that popup window.
Too Slow and unstable. Its year 2023. Even a 'Car Wash' business has an apps now. Your internal budget for online banking apps and marketing must have been gone to somewhere else,i predict. Lastly, 'Riba' is haram😁
Really disappointing with the BANK ISLAM application, it should be easier for every customer when they want to make an online transaction, there must be a problem, please fix it don't waste the customer's time many times have faced this problem very disappointing.
Just updated today and your app just gave me an "Error 500" What does that mean and I've tried uninstall and reinstall a couple of times but it still gives me that error code 500.. please help!
cant login. the same id and password were use in desktop,but keep on sying "invlid credential" in apps. i cant transfer money as the desktop online bankin ask to install this app to setup something at its setting. now useless.
Bad service ever, i wanted to login but keep denying even though already put the right password, then i have to wait within 12 hours before i can proceed for any payment after change the password, please make sure to update this thing
Worst bank app. Most of the time cannot login, high traffic error, lag & slow. I will rate 0 star if given the option.
The bank fund did not reflect the amount I have in my account. When open via website, it shows the amount. But in the app only show zero ringgit.
Slow when open the app and even slower when opened using mobile data. Please fix it ASAP, a lot of people using duitnow and online banking for everyday transaction.
Apps always problem and slow response. Its not convenient if you are in a hurry. This is the worse banking app period.!
Take a long time to just load the screen. For what forcing us to stop using the website and use the apps . Seriously ? Not convenience
Hello Bank Islam, what kind of improve if your apps always stuck and loading? Really troubling the user. The most trouble apps bank that i used, sorry not gonna used this apps anymore, you guys never take this as lesson. Bye forever and ever !!
the application is really bad .. it's been two days since I've been trying to enter or login , I can't .. oh my god . It's hard to make a transaction..
Forced to install to enable online transfer. Installed, went through all the stupid steps, logged me off multiple times. 2 hours in I still can't do anything. Modern day robbery.
Apps is SOOOO problematic. HAVE TO REACTIVATE QR CODE FOR EVERY.SINGLE.USE??!! LOAD TIME?FOREVER EVEN WITH WIFI😑 you update the apps but nothing happens 😩
Very slow apps, difficult to do online transaction (always received error), cannot use screenshot for proof of payment use, always received error so many times, very bad apps...
Please acknowledge all the reviews you received. This apps received 1 star for most of the ratings and bad feedbacks but still no improvement from the admin. Please do something and improve your apps. This apps just make things harder. Even 1 star is over rating.
The worst app i have been used. Update , update, update but nothing improve. Each transaction (above limit) need to approve by app, but cannot open to approve. So HOW? Really annoyed. Does not deserve even for 1 star. Shd be 0.
Not even worth of one star. Slow, sluggish. Login using fingerprint will fail most of the time.
Bro..seriously, i am in urgent to do the transaction and the apps keep on crashing. Open by browser, and need to confirm transaction by using this apps. Seriously?
Very bad system. Doing the transaction online always on lag i can die because of this system makes my food transaction always failed. Shame on you.
The current version is take time to open compared to old version. It's really annoyed. Please upgrade the system.
Cannot even start the app, now online banking through regular web cannot perform online transaction, what other option the user has for online transaction then? Please fix the app. Thank you
Disappointed!! The worse apps in my phone. Eventhough Im using browser, i still need to authorised my transaction through this apps. The problem is i can't even open it. Shame on you bank islam.
Bank islam service didn't improve their log in apps delay even few years. Very bad
Loading takes forever using Redmi note 11s but run smoothly on redmi note 11 pro 5g.
Why got problem when to open ? The app want loading until when ?? Until I have child or i die ? I can't to make payment ! It's so very double triple bad !! Very and very triple disappointed !!!
I do not know why the app so lagging. This really affect my transactions for biz. Have to restart over and over end up using on the web to transfer.
Too many error. From log in up to transferring fund. Please fix the apps, or just remove it from apps store if u are not going to fix it
Bila nak upgrade apps ni? Basic function pun tak tercapai. Duk loading memanjang. Malu la sikit dengan apps Maybank. Contohi apps mereka. . Update: developer noob. Cannot provide even the basic function of the apps
This stupid thing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!@@×!×@!×+I can't load to the app. It's says cannot connect to server. Have been trying many times, still failed 😔
I found that the latest fixes/releases makes this apps better and user friendly
The apps keep on loading until time to do transactions out. Worst banking apps ever.. I had to go to the bank to do it manually..
Please upgrade your apps, hard to access. Sometimes need to wait loading for long time before and after login. Functionality too slow..2 star at the moment until its run smoothly
Very bad experience with this app, please upgrade your system. Poor, incompetent, waste of time, awful at the every corner...
Pls fix ur server or whtever issue it is. I hve experiencing ths issue since ths early 2023 n i have limited patience. I hve been considering changing my bank acc bcos of ths apps
not even worth 1 star. just like other reviewer, the app is now worse after the update. Loading takes forever, online transaction took so long despite having fast internet. Lagi update lagi teruk hmmm
Not deserve a star at all. BIMB need to do drastically changes to make sure this app functionally correctly. Else, it will leads to customer loss to other conventional bank services.
App doesnt do anything (almost all time i used it)! DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING IF IT IS NOT BROKEN!
It takes too long to loading.. And the apps crashed frequently.. it makes it hard to get approval for duitnow system..
Horrible.What is wrong with your apps? Now it is very slow to access my account.It keep on logging, until I give up.. You must keep up with other banks' app!
Previous version much better. Current version always lagging & it is troublesome when i want to use it urgently. Hopefully BIMB can do something.
Always error opening the app. Showing high traffic everytime !!! How to confir. TAC if app always crash ?? Shame lah u manage this app. 😡😡
Lembap gile app ni...nak open app took very long period that I can made coffee baru bole bukak... sometimes the app cannot open cause having inconvenient problem... developer please improve this damn app and fix the problem...other bank apps work smoothly but this app work very dull
Bagus. The banking app has been improved a lot! Thanks!
The apps cannot open or even to register. Also, you need to open the apps for approval transaction even you are doing money transfer through website.stupid application.
if theres a zero star review i would give it to this app...Like seriously?...Why do you need to make a payment everytime we need to go through the app? its stupid and slow
Too bad the apps so bad la. 2 days waiting to make transaction still cannot do. Using website also crashed. Please make an improvement asap.
Very slow. Rubbish app. Sorry to say.
After update cannot open the apps until today.Pervious apps more better.
Update review: JUST PERISH! My balance was deducted when I am sure I never made any transaction recently. This is after updating the app as of 2 oct 2023. App keep showing no transaction history at all! The worst banking app ever. Slow loading, not to mention you have to log in to this trashy banking app whenever you need to verify online transactions through go secure, but sometimes it doesn't even show up. Update and UPGRADE your feature and loading rate or just terminate this app entirely.
Another update and yet this app still disapponts. This time, merely logging in to the app itself is time consuming and stress-inducing; let alone performing online banking transactions via the app, God knows how long it will take. My previous review prevails with add-ons to the already long complaint. Rather appalling given the slow page loading and difficulty of connecting to the app. It was quite frustrating and inconvenient when the app was supposed to have 'streamlined' online banking.
Apps always lagging, some times not responsed, please solve the problem a.s.a.p
Very very bad services. Apps cannot be open and seldomly successful to make transaction. Hoping there will be improvement in near future
The apps keep loading and unable to login.
The worst bank app ever! Its always loading and takes too much time for me to use qr pay. I end up using other bank app which is more fast and efficient
Worst experience ever. Loading takes forever. Simple assignment cannot be done. Plan your schedule weeks ahead or just accept that nothing can be done through this app
Using this apps for quite long and already updated the latest version,but i'm still don't see the improvement using this apps. Worst and too slow.
It's very, way too annoying! Don't bother making an app if you don't intend for it to work! It's been a year or more since I have this app and it keeps crashing all the time. Can count with my finger how many times it work during a year! Please fix this or just delete this app from the playstore, u r making its hard since want to pay shoppee also got through this piece of app!
Can't even open smh.. Alr update, now can open but cannot log in..
Worst working apps. That's I can conclude about this apps..unable to connect to server, traffic bla bla bla. So frustrated.
Apps cant login. Wth is this!? Why do we need to get the securego from the apps when the apps can't even open?! Please fix! I have tons of bills to pay wih due dates!!!
Whoever in charge with developing this app should resign, not competent at all, most of the time not working
I have tried many times to login still cannot login and the password is wrong eventhough i have entered the password correctly. Still having the same problem
This app has been the lousiest since from the beginning. I hope the team will rectify the issue. Everytime error!
the most retarded app on planet, how could this app still exists at this moment. even a snail would be faster than this app, and whose idea was it to confirm the online purchase through this stupid app and thought it would be a great idea when it is slow as hell ?
Its sincerely getting worse!! Its keep loading without getting anywhere. Please fix this asap.. Ppl use it everyday.. If we just open it for it to be loading, then what the point???
Poor app. Not go for user friendly. Not easy to access. Unable to connect the server 😞😞😞
Not happy with the apps efficiency. Loading, loading, loading until the time ended. Please improve your efficiency. So upset
Please fire all of your swqa and dev team and management , lots of bugs in this app slow loading time, lots of items in app dissappearing reappearing randomly
Bank Islam Go is testing my patience. Banyak kena istighfar, banyak kena ingat kepada Allah because when you need to open the app, you can't because of high volume or because they're experiencing technical issues. Fix the app, Bank Islam, once and for good.
As of now (6/11/23 11.51pm) the app stays on loading page. Tried with different type of internet connection but it's still loading. Didn't have any issues through bimb webpage. Only the app. Already tried to restart the phone and open the app again though. P. S: after reading all the recent reviews, makes me wonder, does the latest version of the app is still very bad?
Fixed the rooted device issue on my last review. It gets the job done, but not in optimal way. I'd rather browsing through website compared to this. Loading each page was slow, even website version load faster. Whenever I wanted to do transfer be it IBG or Instant Transfer, I have to reinput my password again. I cannot use fingerprint authentication, as it was only for first app login. Another hassle for me.
Trash app. Can't even load the login page
I cannot open the app after so many tries. This makes it harder to do a transfer. Please resolve the problem faster. Thank you.
Transaction error error error error error non stop. Seriously noob, super useless especially TAC, making functional apps and services super trash. Just fired whoever team that development this apps.
The worst worst worst worst bank apps ever!!!!!! Take forever to load even though the wifi signal is good.. The web server is better than this stupid apps!!! But the web server is not that good also!!!!
I hardly login to this apps nowadays..It keeps loading,showing the circling icon everytime when ever I try to open it. Delete and reinstall many times,but the problem still the same..If this keep happens, I wont be able to use my Bimb online services since it is required to be approved from this apps, and it is so troublesome.
The worst banking app in Malaysia I've used. Everything loads up very poorly. You want to pay some stuff at the store using qr? Well, you'd die of old age first. Even the Bank Islam website sucks. People that uses this intentionally are masochists.
Supposed to be, an app make things easier. But this apps make things harder. Everytime I downloaded it, I need to key in the data like I'm a totally new user. Although I re-install it on the same device. Worst experience is today. When it magically TOTALLY log out. And when I try to login, it told me to key in data like I'm a new user. Need to re-setup qr pay. Need to key in IC number. The same app that has been running quite a few times before this on the same device. Deserve 0 star I think.
After the new update version, I cant log in as the notifications keep on saying "unable to connect to the server" which is very hassle and time consuming to deal with. Very disappointed with the buggy apps and it doesnt seem helpful at all. Not sure if this happens to android users only or not.
Very very very poor online bank service. Have to try sooo many times before your transaction success using this apps. Please improve your poor service guys.
Apps got lots of prob during startup. Reinstall and its gna deauthorize ir registered phone when all u want is to use back. Trash quality.
Bad interface and the worst of all, the line and the online services of the app is barely bearable at most. 0 star.
The apps took time for every process even log in also take too long . Very dissapointed . Sometime its very hard to make money transfer 👎
What happen to this app, it took more time to open it, sometime it waste my time to wait just to transfer the money but in the end i could't.
Fix the bugs and improve the server.
Been using the apps but lately the apps become suck. Super snail and giving a fuss to the customers. Please do something fast or ur going to loose a lot of customers
Apps selalu error. So bila nak transfer, guna biz online, tapi tetap perlu approval dari apps ni yg langsung tak boleh buka. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bank islam should remain with web saja. No need app. Youre not ready to use app bila selalu error. Menyusahkan user.
Very disappointed with the apps. Take very long time to login and even cant doo fpx transaction. This app should make life easier with cashless payment nowadays.
The Go app sooo slow n not responsive in good time. Its take too long for app to activate..its not help for urgent matter when to used it.
I can't open up the apps .. how i'm gonna make transaction? 😭 i already update to the latest One
When we r already at the cashier and the apps dont even work. There and then we tried to uninstal n reinstal.. but sometimes it wont work also after reinstall 🥲
Slow , Cannot do any transfactions. Then its better after the comments
unresponsive. very slow. give you good hard headache .
Till still dont have any updated. I cant even open my app. Why your system is too bad? Please solve this problem! Why have update when is causing more trouble to user!
It is definitely the slowest bank application in Malaysia. I have Maybank, Standard Chartered, Public Bank, UOB, Alliance, OCBC application in my phone. Bank Islam easily the winner in this category. Keep up the good work although I highly doubt that any other bank will be able to defeat you in term of buggy and laggy.
Worst bank app. Slow and always not responsive. Please, I BEG of you, please, make development for this app. Make it function as good as other bank apps.
Please upgrade your online banking system.There is always a problem when users want to log in and always use the excuse that your internet line is problematic but in fact it is not.Please take action as soon as possible because many users want to use it to pay all commitments.Thank you
cannot open the app after the update. Should fix this as it keep on loading for a long time.It still cannot open up to 3 days until now.
So slow to open this app, hopefully this problem will be solve in tge future.
Frequently lags. Loading to log in page very slow. Overall not very secure.
App Server always shows a slow as a snail app's navigation. Kindly check the server in case of hacker intrusion.
Very bad apps. The loading time is so long & it's really not convenient to use it compared to website. If you want to develop an apps make sure it is user friendly and very dissatisfied with this apps. Every transaction is very difficult and make your worry whether it is already successful to be transfer or not. Please make a change. Thank you.
I cannot open the app since I downloaded the new version. It kept showing the Unable to Connect to Server box everytime I open the app. I have been using it for 2 years and it got its up and down, but this time is the worst. And since everything needed to be aunthenticate using the Go app, found it very inconvenient and a huge hassle. Please do something about it. Thank you.
This app is extremely terrible, shame on the developers for not fixing it. Might as well use other alternatives than this slowpoke.
The login part kinda slow while waiting for loading. Sometimes, it freezes and crashed.
Always need updated. Every transaction need approval by secure site (this case, by Bank Islam Go)..but pending and buffer too much. Not user friendly...
Slow, lag and not user friendly
Very bad IB apps. Always shows error even though it has been updated to the latest. Please do something for the customers or else Bank Islam IB will always receive bad reviews.
Slow and laggy..almost every time cant sign in..need to relaunch the app several times.. tonight issue "cant connect to server".
After I put id, password, ic, I waited for a long time to get IAC number but it didn't send it to my mobile number! It's so annoying app!
"unable to connect to server" this problem has occurred few months now. very troublesome. edit : after reinstall this app, I finally can use it as before. BUT, the loading screen before entering the password took FOREVER 😢 if any of you having the same issue, and you are reading this, please clear the app's cache. it makes the app smoother
Loading slow, cant do transaction without it. So much for security when u cant even do a simple transaction
Love this apps. Easy and convenience to access. Go Bank Islam dah BETTER. Alhamdulillah.
PLEASE HIRE BETTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPER. CUSTOMER CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE. SLOW SLOW SLOW, MAINTENANCE ALL THE WAY. SOMETIMES FUNCTION CAN'T BE USED. REBOOT THIS APP PLEASE.
The apps is getting worse day by day. Been waiting for more than 10 mins just to get in...and sometimes didn't even get to log in.
This app is getting worsen day by day, super slow and laggy and not advanced like other banks apps. Please improve your apps service.
Your rating now 1.3..only 1 star..probably ending with no star if playstore allow us... each time update your apps keep freezing... stuck at loading page..do something.. look at your competitor..maybank..cimb...all good
Previous version is better..i cannot see my balance in TH after the update
Bad experience.. alway lag and have lots of problem especially on QR Code and scanning.. why even develop this app if you have no intention to maintain it?
to slow connection..fail..upset...more complicated
This app is really slow, maybe because of the server. Really need to upgrade the responds time for the sistem.
It's fine when it works, but right now it doesn't work more often than it does. Which is a problem since BIMB is now forcing their clients to use this app for transaction approvals. When you want to do that, then the app needs to be reliable, which this app is obviously not. It's taken me several tries and I still can't transfer my money.
Please la... So slow when open the apps, for 30+ min only "pusing-pusing". And please consider to bring back TAC since you apps can't even open to authorize my purchase
The GO secure function is really frustrating. Always didn't work in crucial time. Please do something with your apps.
New update problem. This app stuck at asking me to accept / reject payment. But I did not do any payment. Please repair the problem.
Worst app ever, unable to log in around pay day week 25th until end of month for every month. Really difficult to make any online transaction during this period.
Cannot scan qr from gallery..i already have latest version on my one plus 11
Worst ever, cannot check available balance at all. Any banking payment also lag and too slow. What happen????
da update.. tapi apa yg lambat sgt nk bukaknya..yg lama lagi better than new veraion.. take so long to. open.. disappointed betul dgn isu apps bank islam ni
This app keep loading everytime we try to use it. It really annoying since every online transaction need to be verified by this app.
Loading too long, access denied, then say i had logged in, cant even open in web, clear data and force stop then working, this apps clearly is broken.
Update in April 2023 It's becoming worse. I can't even open the app even after reinstalling it after clear history, cache and reset phone. Recent update is causing problems to open the app. I am unable to use it completely. It take ages to open as well as use the GO verification. I uninstalled, clear cache multiple times with wifi and data connection without any success. I am sure the problem comes from the app itself.
This is most worst bank app in Malaysia. I wonder why Uitm compulsory for student to use Bank Islam as main student bank account?. App very slow, always show loading bubble, I'm unable to log in to app. Bank Islam you are multimillion company, you are supposedly able to upgrade and fix app without problem. New update: I'm done!!!. Time to close Bank Islam account or let's account became dormant. I'm suggest user closed account and change to Maybank MAE and Cimb Octo or transfer to TNG E-wallet.
Bank islam banking app is the slowest and the worst . Server always doesnt work. Imagine trying to pay using the app and u just stare at the loading white page for 30 minutes
I hv tried mny times to pay my bills last few days but never can log in go apps. U shud provide alternative. So disappointing.
Unable to do fund transfer. Keep getting error code. The basic function of transferring money is not properly develop.
Why i cannot check my Tabung Haji account? The apps already update latest version 10. Please assist
I've updated this app and I've lost RM13 once I logged in. Have been checked the transaction history and didn't know where it goes. I still remember the balance in my account. Plus, I just went to ATM a week ago. The amount is still fresh in my head. Got the receipt too. I'm truly disappointed and can no longer trust it. What if losing large amount of money after this? It's scary. I guess I should uninstall this app :( it's no longer secure for me
Why always loading, take to long loading, sign out suddenly, need to uninstall and install back and came out with box that stated i need to performed transaction to TH, DUIT NOW AND OTHERS AFTER 12 HOURS.
I keep on getting 'unable to connect to server' issues and sometimes had to reinstall the apps due to crash and all. Is there any explanation to this? Issues like this have made it so difficult for me to make a transaction especially on important one. So, I'm truly disappointed. I hope you all can fix this. It hindred people's business and matter. Also, why does the app won't allow screenshot? Sometimes, I forgot to share my receipt and try to find back my transaction record but can't screenshot
Please fix... keep getting error exceeded daily limit when making transaction. Need to switch using browser instead, such a hassle...
The apps keeps crashing even i uninstall it. My id also cannot be detected. Why it keeps on loading????
Very disturbing.. every transactions becomes hard due to error of system. It takes time and not efficient at àll. Please update ur service at it is very slow and not working. The service is still not working despite having reinstalled a few times. Saying that I haven't registered though just send me verification of successful register.!!???
Worst banking apps. Keep loading although internet line is good. Unable to access the app for online transactions. Please improve
After the update, the app keep crashing and pop up said "server error, unable to connect to server". This has been going for weeks and I can't use duitnow for most of my purchases and transfer which is frustrating. Why the update bring down the app instead of "fixing the bug" like the update state. I'm mortified and scared at the thought my account can be easily hacked while the app crashing.
Much more worst. I cannot login to my acc and usually if i want to login, it always pop out 'high volume of traffic.' what-
why need to relaunch the app for confirmation in online transaction, seriously then it stuck just loading forever. please fix asap ! edit : if i can give 0 star i will give it, have been use for a long time and theres no imrprovement in this app, what are you doing? cant this app be like other bangking app?
Forced to stay hungry the whole day without money because app is down & online banking down, and contactless card transaction cannot be used. I really hate this bank.
Looking forward for better online service. This apps too slow for loading and frequent error issue on server.
too slow and laggy. sometimes need to wait for a long time to login. when to approve transaction even took a long time. please improve tremendously your app bank islam.
Every time update new version. Making it more complicated in all ways. Fingerprint can't access, face recognition take times, need 2 times key in password, auto log out, buffering at all the time until i sleep and wake up on the next day and still buffering. Neither use android or ios, the experience of using is still the same, getting worse.
The worst banking apps... Always loading for so long. Had to do everything in website since the apps is always having prob.
App paling useless. Susah nk access, loading then lastly tak boleh nk buka pun.
Too slow to load in login page. I want to use urgently QR Pay yesterday.
i think no star for this application. very bad. so stress use this. take so long time to open. difficult to transfer/payment. waste time!!
Slow and this app should be optional, not users need to download your app just to use your services. Make it optional.
Worse bank app ever. Can't event log in. Take so much time to load around 5-10 minutes. Pls fix. I'm a student so it's hard for me to pay some stuff
App keeps getting crash and error for login. Please please fix this. Even nak bukak online punya kt website pun slow sangat ya. Do something to fix this asap.
Ever since the Error 500 appeared, the app collapsed and unable to be open. Tried deleting cache, data, force stop it but nothing works. I wanted to do simple transactions using DuitNow but I can't. Uninstalling and reinstalling is a lot of work because you have to setup your account back.
Why remove the option to make transactions using the website? Seems like another unnecessary application that you must download for basic banking service. At least give us a choice!
It has been almost a week i cant access to my account. Last week was due to huge traffic. Today, unable to connect to server.
Please fix this app. It is annoying when you need to transfer money urgently but this app takes tooooooo longgggg loading. Very bad app.
Really slow. I can't stress this enough. My patience is running even thinner every time I need to use this app. Why we need to authorise from the app when the app is this slow? I looked at your replies to the other users and they're just the same things being said over and over again. It really shows that you don't care about us. I already cleared the cache and uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but still can't even log in. I've done the best that I can, so why can't you guys do the same?
Super slow, super clunky, super inefficient
Bad..Cannot even open the app..many times say 'Currently under maintenance'. Hard to do transactions. Please fix the issue.
I cant open this apps after update!!!previous better than this!!! Fix it!!!
Unable to install ..only able to open using playstore then problem to do transfer ..I think this is worst app ever then other bank ...please do something
Very slow app, it take a long time just to open the app and most of the time i cannot access the app at all.
Deserves no star. The worst app for a bank. Loading too long. Always lag and crash. Serioulsly this app needs improvements
Where is the menu to view transaction signing? Adding or deleting favorite accounts has become difficult! If you click on the Transaction Signing notification bar while using the apps, it won't redirect to the correct page to approve the transaction. And there is no way to view the current Transaction Signing! Inbox messages cannot be clicked too! Disappointing! This apps is only good to view the current balance, that's all!
Among the dumbest feature with this apps is they didnt let me screen shot due to privacy policy THIS JUST REALLY EXTREMELY BOTHERING ME, I CANT SHARE MY PAYMENT PROOF BECAUSE I FORGOT TO SHARE THE PDF FILE AFTER I PAID MY SELLER AND I PROCEED TO HOME SCREEN END UP CANT TAKE SCREENSHOT ANYWHERE WITHIN THE APPS? WHY CIMB APPS DIDNT DO THIS? SO WHY WOULD YOU?
Can't login since yesterday. Already updated the app. 🤬
why this apps can't screenshot.. I can't give any proof too seller when i buy some thing when transfer the money. and this app always hank, then must uninstall n reinstall again n again..
No star for a bad apps. Im 1st time want to register. Cannot open at all and just appeared server error!!
Hello, I can't open my apps to check my account. It just said server error. Even the website can't be open. Please fix it.
I can't log-in to the app using my new phone. I have been installing and uninstalling the app for many time but the problem keep on going. Whenever I try to log-in, the app suddenly close. Like when i fill up my bank id and it started loading then the app close and it went back to my phone homepage. I tried many time and I nearly reach to the final step, but it still suddenly close. Please solve this problem quickly cause it is inconvenience to make a transactions thru the website. Thank you.
Always load for a very long time especially when I'm trying to make transaction causing the transaction to be cancelled.
one of the worse performing online banking app with multiple downtimes and bugs
Worst. Always encountered Server Error Unable to connect to the server. What should I do then???
After i updated, i cnnot log into the app anymore!
Makin Update, Makin teruk. Kena clear data storage setiap kali nak launch app ni...
Loading screen took so long and keep getting error message . Sometime biometric also cannot use .
A very unreliable piece of technology. Takes forever to go to login page, and sometimes even fail. I have to clear cache and storage then reopen to see the login page. To transfer money, the bank require the GO authorization but when you cannot even open the app and login this will make it useless. I suggest to first remove the need for GO authorization and stick to 6 digit codes until you guys fix the issues for your app. 1 star review overall is not a very good look for the brand. Best of luck
Cant open the app, it stuck on loading screen
Dear developer, This app always stuck on login. When log in to app, I cannot log in to other browser. I want transfer my money to pay for the thing i buy. Fix this god dam stupit mf apps lah weh. Learn from MAE, CIMB Click and others.. Developer lena ka..
Fix this app at least please. Cannot take screenshot for proof of payment. And loading , took forever. Apps is not so friendly user.
Need to approve transaction in app, app forever loading. At least give option for sms code for fak sake. Might actually change bank just because of this app
Please fixed this apps, it was not stable sometimes I can login using fingerprint sometime its cannot..if I can put 1/2 star ..that is your rating I can give to your app
Been using this app for years and it was smooth. But after recent update, it just went from good to worst! Whenever i tried to login, keep on pop-up 'unable to reach server'. Super annoying! Then i uninstall and re-install, looks fine but when i keyin my ic number, it detect as error. U guys please fix it asap.
By far the worst banking app. Always auto logged out due to the server issue. And to login will require few attempts which is ridiculous. The UI is bery basic and sometimes a bit confusing for example hard to notice which one is required field. Why don't you just suggest to re-install the app? BIMB User. Person_A: can just transfer me the money. Me: Great! Lemme uninstall and install this wonderful banking app.
problem app,i cannot open the apps for swveral times
Such a nuisance/ problematic/ inconvenient apps..need to do transaction asap, but not able to open apps or even online banking..what a turndown..improve la bank islam
I don't know what's wrong with Bank Islam app anymore. Previous version is more stable, easy and user-friendly. And now? Double menyusahkan users.
0.5 star if i can put here. The worst apps for banking. I cant even open the apps properly to accept the transaction. Just keep the tac style laa, dont copy other banking apps. Haiyaaa!
The worst online banking apps Ive used. It took forever just to load. Then another forever to load any payment methods.
Better than Road Runner . Just imigine.
The function of this apps make so difficult to transfer my money to make payment for my car n my grab n all my apps.. Why this apps took so long to loading. 2 days waiting n still loading.. Do something bnk islam why so weak
Shouldn't have given a star. First of all this is inconvenient at all. The website is much more better. I'm trying to do a single transaction over days but still can't. Go to 'Go secure' put in the digits still NOTHING. The needs to log in everytime and then the apps log out suddenly when making transaction so irritating. Plus the 'not valid' when literally just a second after log in. A single transaction but this much troubles is so frustrating. It's making me lost temper everytime.
Very bad. App is not working. Even after update. Any other way to do online transfer now?
I have been using the app for more than a year (maybe) and there have been massive improvements, kudos to the developers 👍🏻 I'm looking forward to future improvements especially in these 3 aspects - a more friendlier GUI (not too robot-ish please), a more complete/comprehensive transfer experience and frequent updates to fix the bugs. Additionally I have a question, the ability to add fav transfers is actually also not available on other banking apps, is it for security reasons?
I want to transfer money urgently but they asked to download the go bank apps. The darn app cannot even be accessed. Failed to connect to server. Wth
This is the worst app ever. I can't even tap go secure how do I want to transfer for online banking, this is so annoying
Worst app, always loading and high volume traffic. Need approvement and be like a maybank app easier to people. Go to online banking site also same.
The app suddenly cannot open , it say server error.. Already tried to uninstall and install back but still same. Why ahhh ayoooooooooo
System always down .. very hard to make online transaction . if this have ZERO star , i will rate this . Its been years !
Almost there with BSN with the most inefficient banking service in Malaysia. Useless apps / online platform every end of the month
Cant even access the apps..transfer through website but it to go to the apps to be able to transfer..but everytime i want to access cant even enter the apps..the apps always problem..
Pleaseeeeee update the app to be faster.I am really annoyed using this app.the login session itself took about more than one minute.please change your technical team or hire the better new team ASAP!
Apps are so slow and annoying. I keep getting access denied. Please improve it.
This app does not deserve even one star. Keep loading until forever cannot be used, always in high traffic issue.
not a good bank app. Loading for very long time. Got problem when to buy stuff on shopee & when i want to topup my internet. I can't take it anymore
Wouldn't even give this app a single star if I could. You forced us to use this app for such security reason but didn't even manage to even come with a good apps. Please do some quick improvements
The previous version is better. The current app is so slow and annoying. Please fix this ASAP!
The server always got error, please fix it! I can't even log in to my account because of that!
The apps is definitely less convenient than the website. But, nothing out of expectation. Because depending on the data you use the loading time of the apps may be slower or faster. Sometimes cannot use it because it was under maintenance but definitely not because of the apps itself if unable to use it. It also depends on your phone specs and storage. 😉
Getting worst day by day.Make it verify on the app after using the web for transaction.But the app was not working properly and immidiate urgent transaction all getting delay.
CAN'T USE AT ALL. LOADING FOR A LONG TIME THEN ERROR. TRIED UNINSTALL THEN REINSTALL BUT SAME RESULT. ITS BEEN ALMOST A WEEK. PLEASE FIX IT IMMEDIATELY. THANK YOU. IM A LONG-TIME USER
This app make me spoil to do on9 transaction still cannot use and so bad to me,ples take action to solve this problem ASAP to give and make excellent app for easy to use tq
Now can't even open app. Keeps saying high volume of traffic and tell us to try again later. EPIC FAIL
Slow n loading. Apa punya app laaaa. Buatla sesuatu.
Please improve service quality.. cannot be relied upon much needed.. it suck... The worse apps ever.. Do you guys don't have the person that can handle this ke . Shame lah .. Bank lain ada apps, bank hang pun nak buat apps .. buat lah betul betul.. buat kerja dengan kaki ke?
Please do fix your app. I been try to open the app to pay via QR. Its been 2 hours trying to open it. Still fail to do so. Soo emberassing when want to buy something and pay using QR.
We were forced to use this app for our online transactions. But this app caused alot of problem. Server error. Cant connect to the server. Etc. Please Bank Islam don't so unprofessional. Dont cause your customers alot problems. Must I keep on unistalling and then reinstalling again to use your app? People complained but its look as if there is still no improvement. The customers still have had difficulties to use this app. So frustrated
This bank app is by far the worst. It's very slow to load, at least 2 mins at the loading screen. I am not exaggerating! Crashes all the time. Verification details sometimes doesn't appear. Seriously, how does a relatively big bank have such an app? I sincerely hope a major improvement is done soon!
Why won't you take action eventho you have 1.2 ratings? Is user satisfaction not important? This app take too much times to load that makes it harder for any transaction especially after 'go secure' features. If you made an app that is this slow you should just use TAC number. Don't bother request for a rating if your company don't take action at all.
VERY BAD experience. The switching between the acc is so not user-friendly. And now I have a problem to access my company acc because of "invalid credential". I need an urgent transfer and now THIS. If you want to make every transfer more secure by doing this, please make sure the app is good-enough. I hope to see the improvements. Pleasseee...
I cannot access this app as the app unable to connect with the server. I hope this thing can be settle asap.
Terrible! Worst online banking I've ever had. Kasi tutup sajalah app!
The app is soo buggy. It just keep on loading after opening the app. If it didn't stuck loading, it will take a few minutes for it to finish loading and show the login screen. What's the point of having an app if it much more of a hassle to use. By far the most horrible banking app i ever used.
Please improve your user experience. App cannot open and cannot approve any transaction. What is the point of having the app if cannot be open
many times unable to load and log in . bank islam please upgrade your services apps
Everytime nak guna, had to wait flipping long time, the berudu keep spinning infinitely. Please improve BIMB
Not recommended tbh. After the recent update, it logged me off and I had to re-register into the app and it crashed after inputting the security code. Many. Times. There's also instances where it kept having issues even before this. And here I thought the octopus app is bad, but this is next level of terrible.
Dah uninstall, lepas tu install balik but still tak boleh bukak pun apps. Bad services.
Sehari semalam dah cuba log in. Asyik loading jaaaaaaa. I dont know when will this apps function well. Always unable to log in. Worst bank apps ever.
very bad experience. after a year uninstalled this app, still no improvement. teruk sangat, please improve lah!!!!!!
The worst app ever..i got the same issue with others..this app became very bad, take time to log in and slow than before..
It's been a week now and the app can't be opened at all. I can't even log in the system. Please fix this issue ASAP
What wrong with your apps recently? After updating the system suddenly i cannot open it at all?!?! Fix it faster please. This issue have not being fixed even after more than 1 week. Dissapointing. It have been very convenient to use it past few years but not anymore. I can't even open it now!
An annoying incompetent app. I can't even get to the log in page, it just keeps on uselessly loading for eternity. The most infuriating thing is that every transaction needs GO authorization, so I'm just here unable to pay my student debt for months. If you're going to make it so important at least make it usable at the very least. FIX IT.
To much buffering. Server need to be upgrade to ensure system running smooth. Nak transfer duit pun payah. Kalau server down notify la customer. Bukan duduk diam je. Ni every hour nak try login utk access tp error sama je. Takkan notify pun ego juga.
Terrible. It used to be the most handy app for transactions. Now i can't even get through the login page. What happened BIMB?? Apps are supposed to make online banking easier but this is the other way around. It has been going on for months now eversince the most recent update. Would very much appreciate if your team can find the problem and fix it asap!
Always have bug n need to be updated.so annoying
Why so much problem lately with Bank Islam apps? Can't even authorize payment and error pops APZ_TSN_0001 transaction is expired (when it is not)
Bad and terrible. The most annoying baking app ever. U don't understand how it can be worser than it was already is. The loading takes far too long and then suddenly cannot login anymore. The go secure is not available to approve anything, can't even click and always error.
Can i know how long you are making this app to loading.. I'm waiting for a long time to open this application.. Please make it faster to open or don't have any loading app
Worse experience of all banking app. Please make good old times TAC than using fully method GO app. I can't even launching the app
What is the purpose to force your customers to use unstable application service? It's very hard to open the application and how will it looks for us when we need to pay instant in front of a counter? Is this another type of promoting method for encourage your customers to change bank?
Takes forever to load the Ui, fingerprint login failed most of the time, lots of server errors and incomplete displayed infos. *Using a good phone w high speed data and more than decent urban speed, screen sensor works in every other app enabled fingerprint access. So, IT'S THE APP & SERVER. And....did the switch off on phone,clear cache, reset data, uninstall reinstall stuffs. So..Yeah.
Worse experience with new version apps. Bank islam take very long time to solve the apps problems. Very disappointed 😔
It's been two weeks since the latest update and the same problem hasnt been solved, 'unable to connect to server', unable to log in. The only solution that they can provide is 'please reinstall', 'please use the lastest version' as if we havent done it before. Very disappointing. Would rate a zero if I could.
very incredibly slow ive never seen an app this slow fix it even with good internet connection it keeps lagging and takes forever to load
I am okay with the Apps, it is easy to use and I have no issue of logging into the Apps. The only problem that I encountered is receiving the IAC. I have to request new IAC at least twice everytime when performing online transactions (it took me longer time to complete just a transfer). Please advise. Thanks.
App paling mudah nak pakai... Sometime problem.. Tp masih better than others
Worst banking apps. Changing transaction limit should not take too long to be effective. Lol
Not supposed to be any star. The worst app ever. Not user friendly, not worth having it. I can't even make any transaction via online or the app. If not 'no service' its either 'error' for whatever reason. Worst of all it say session exp. Like what the F!! I just open the thing like few seconds ago. Keep logout for no reason too. It was easier before if I need to pay immediately or for emergency now it take almost a whole day just to make 1 transaction.
Just to login need a lot time of waiting. How to make transaction with this kind of problem. Make thing more complicated
I thought making an app should ease the users, not make it more difficult. Its annoying that every time the app has an issue need to uninstall and reinstall back app or update it, and bimb doesn't send notification on updates of the app or app issue so its really hard to know what's the problem. The website page is much more easier to use compare to the app.
Apps paling slow antara online banking . Please upgrade. Penat nk tnggu loading
I have to give two stars only as for now the transactions that can only be use in the app confirmation to do any transactions online like buying from Shopee and it take a lot of time for user to be able to do that stuff then before that more faster which is using an old way which is receiving the TAC code. It also take a lot of attempts to make the transactions successfully completed. I hope Bank Islam can improve this con/problem as fast as it could. That all from me. Thank you.
Improved a lot but still can improve for better.
Why can't take the screenshot? I tried to take a few screenshots but still can't..
Worse, app loading very slow.. money transfer also late. Sometimes i pay double just because this app very slow
It was easy navigation & functioning really good before, but now just to log in I have to try 3-4 times, then after log in, to do transaction also it keeps on loading until the session expired. Is it safe anymore. Please do something, before I change my banks. Dont ask me to make a report again, just read this & do something quick. Bank should be reliable & secure!!
For the 4th time I'm writing this review until the dev team can fix the bug. So here goes, I got stucked at the loading screen even when I'm connected to the internet. After loading, it goes to the 'good afternoon' page, it was a blank page, no button or whatsoever, got stucked there. Uninstall the app and installed it again, same thing happened. I can conclude this app is non functinal and utterly useless. Step up your game and learn from MAE ;)
Stuck at login page and never got through. Been having the problem for the last 2 months. After the new update, it gets worse. Now, could never use the app, have to use the browser version. In process of transferring all my funds into another bank, because their app dont give me this kind of problem. Thanks.
You guys need to do something about this app. It keeps crashing, no matter how many times reinstall the app. This is one of the most important channel to do transactions, yet it happens to be so lagged, not responsive and keep popping error. Afraid that u r losing customers, sir.
After update the latest version the app doesn't open at all & not supporting. Once the app open, it automatically close it by itself. It's vry difficult to perform any transactions & need to use chrome or desktop. The problem has been continued for more than 3 weeks. Regretting for updating the latest version😒
the survey always have a problem, always be dragging my time, always crashing like everytime i wanna make a payment, what do you guys even doing? by just keep updating the app but the app are stil the same with the old problems? what a waste of time. All of the reviews from the users have been stating the same problem but nothing changed. Do your work properly by fixing the bug and so on. My connection doesn't have a problem but the app are just horrible. Do what you need to do. PLEASE FIX THIS
So far so good. Maybe take a look into the back button function, it's better to not directly logout, just instead go back to the previous screen. Same as most of users, the biometric login doesn't work. And when will the DuitNow will be integrate into the GO app? Much easier to transfer money if it is available.
Although to the internet connection is strong the apps remain weak as usual. It will take at least 15 minutes most of the time use the apps services. Sometimes to even open the apps it will take too much time. Hopefully, this can be resolved quickly as it will waste a lot of time especially for those who were in rush because of their jobs or important matter.
The app was superb but not anymore. The last update really messed this app up. It has been a week or more since it can be accessed. Now, it keeps telling server error every time the app is opened. I don't see any immediate fixed on this one ever since. Very disappointed. I'm giving one star for now.
The worst bank that I have used ever. 1. When open the bank app, it shows loading icon for 2-3 minutes before enter into the next page. 2. Many times when I do online transaction, Go secured does not respond or announce "transaction failed" etc... has always wasted my time & energy to try to uninstall & reinstall then re-login 3. Stupid main page that shows the account balance BIG & BOLD, which make has no sense of privacy at all.
This is the worst banking app I have ever used. Lately it has been almost useless. Takes ages to to work, not to mention the endless moments of frustration when it displays 'high traffic volume', among others. At shop checkout I often keep other customers waiting while waiting for the app to work, if at all . What a shame for a bank. With the all the bad reviews I don't see the problems solved. Please don't keep telling users to clear cache or what not...I am sure they do that all the time.
Update, it is getting worse, I cant access my account at all. When I logged in it just load then straight up logged me out. I cant access my account at all and the "Server Error" keep on popping up. This app should make it easier for me to transfer money etc but now, I have to use the website. This happens after I updated the app.
Since the start of my usage of GO, I realise the loading time has always been very slow. Frequently javing server error or simply an error to connect. Its like, almost all cashiers at my local stores would describe to me anyone who uses the white/red app is a bad choice and the yellow or Blue app, is the right choice. MasyaAllah how can this be persistent for almost half a year now. Im sure you all have your Tech team. If the interface has problems, whatabout the security, is it questionable too
App always hang and I need to always reset the ibanking because for some reason, they keep telling me I got the credentials wrong. Resetting password is also another issue and always in circles. End up with the issue not resolved. Overall disappointed with the app, the website is more or less the same as well. Only a matter of time for me to close my BIMB account.
App is very slow. Most of the time I can't even log into the app as it just keeps on loading for a very long time. Don't tell me to clear cache, clear storage, reinstall bla bla bla. I'VE TRIED AND IT JUST DOESN'T WORK. Very frustrating. This problem has been going on since last year. Seems to me like they didn't want to take initiative to fix the issue.
The apps become useless if you are in need-to-hurry situation. It takes so much time to load the first page before can use the service. A lot of time, its faster to open browser and go to the site compare to using the apps itself. Then, it defeats the purpose of having the apps in the first place.
Why is it that everytime on salary day, I can't open the app? I had to uninstall & install again. It just get annoying because I need to set up again from the start. The app itself is easy too use, so i wish this would be resolved quickly. Edit (3 May): The developer response to my email regarding my issue pretty quickly, even tho I email them late at night... So, kudos. Improve my rating. Still cannot actually give 5 star la cuz still not perfect.
Always problem when open...buffering until forever
The app is slow and always loading and failed to enter. Everytime i want to make transaction, i need to uninstall and reinstall the app. Can you do something about this? It's such a hassle to uninstall and reinstall every single time when i need to do transaction. Update based on reply by admin : I have never experience this problem with other bank app. I don't have to clear cache to enter any other bank app.
Since the new update, opening the apps is impossible. Always gets stuck at the log in page. Have uninstalled and installed so many times, but the issue of being stuck at log in page is still the same. It makes it difficult to use the GO app to make payments or transactions.
Garbage app, keep getting "Server Error, unable to connect". The website was working fine before and now you need the app to approve duitnow transfers. Why fix thing that was not broken? When you are able to actually access your account, navigation within the app is also sluggish and slow. It takes forever to just do a simple transfer. Seriously considering closing my bank islam account and migrate to a better service.
Why the app is so slow? When I opened the app, the loading animation will play like forever. Can't access the app at all. I have already cleared the cache, I have cleared the data, didn't work. I have uninstalled and installed the app again, worked but only the first time login. Next time I want to login this thing happened again. The app used to work properly now what happened? It has been like this since middle of last year. Were there no fix?
I can't log-in to the app using my phone. I have been installing an uninstalling the app for many time but the problem keep on going. I try to log-in the app suddenly close. I tried to many time and i nearly reach to the final step, but its suddenly close. Please solve the problem quickly. Thank you.
Been using this app over a year. While it has it's drawbacks over its competitors, GO is definitely an upgrade over the old system where you need to access your account from your browser. The app's responsiveness is a bit lacking but overall it achieved its basic functionality.
Very poor apps. Once installed, tried to sign in a few times. Each time it says server problem. Finally was able to sign in. But the balance shown is zero which is impossible coz the would definitely ask me to close the account. Tried again later. Same thing. Zero balance. So decided to uninstall. Please look at other banks app especially maybank. It's much more friendlier.
Please do something, it's not easy to log in, sometimes can, at some times cannot. Already done the clear cache step n using mobile network, reinstall a few times n it's still the same. It's very annoying as we need to use apps for higher amount transaction. Why bother update the apps when the previous version is much better??
Always unable to access the system due to server error or unable to connect to server. I have tried almost everything including switching from data to wifi, but still not working. The app is very inconvenient. Please do something about it.
UX is good enough but need some improvement. Eg, the fingerprint approval for duit now. After logged in to the system with finger print must have approval again but of on main menu no need. Wierd isn't it? Overall, the app was good but feels unpolished and inconsistent. Maybe can ask for more budget for app development next time. If development is on the way then can wait to try.
Cannot log in the apps since day 1 after set up. Install and uninstall few times also. Logging in always error "APZ_TSN_0003" came up. Tried both Mykad / IC number with and without dash "-" but still unable to log in. Tried using home secured wifi as well as phone own internet data but not successful - same error code number came up. Not sure how to rate this apps. However , using the same usename, same password for internet banking - works fine and able to perform all transaction needed.
Please fix your apps! I'm getting difficulties to view the accounts. If let say the network is unstable and the apps lost connection, User not able to logout. When I re-login again, looks like I need to wait for another 24 hours!!!! Open account with you wasting my time. Poor apps services, just like BSN.
I've been having issues logging in since 3weeks now, been reinstalling the apps many times but the same problems keep showed up "couldn't connect to the server" "high network trafficking, too many users" bla3. But even up until today, the app wont fix. It was working perfectly fine before the update, now it has become haywire & I can't do cashless transactions no more. Pls fix the app ASAP developer?!
Oh ya guys, about the "unable to connect to server" problem, i think you guys should uninstall the application, and then install again. I think it worked out for me. I'm not sure if it works for you, but can give it a try ☺️. I saw the notice on the website, i think it supposedly to work like that.
It's not really functional. The fingerprint doesn't work and the app keep getting frozed. I kept installed and reinstalled but still the same. Theres a time that it can be use and there's a time that can't. I have to use the old fashion way which is via web page key in manually to log in. Please take note and fix it as internet banking is very important nowadays.
I don't understand. It's so weird, where this time I updated the app. Later, when I logged in, there's noti pop up saying it needs a change in permission setting which I really don't understand what's that permission for. Previously, it mentioned about accessing my location, which I refused to. Then, my app didn't work.
Very very bad app, sorry Bank Islam but you shouldn't make an app if it's not giving convenience to the users. The problem is not even with the interface but the server itself - very long loading time, easily crashed, can't function properly, can't take high traffic, etc. Please fix it, you're losing users' trust!
This time I had to re install the apps. Once installed I am able to go in and used the apps. But after logging out and tried to re enter, I am unable to go in. It seems that the icon save on phone screen is not responding when I touched it. Sorry no screenshot. Already installed and uninstalled several time.
It's a good app but I hope the developer can link the internet banking history and mobile banking history and make it into one single history list. Plus, I cannot download the receipt of transaction I made. Even there is a download button, it's for all transaction. Not details. Just able to screenshot only.. So, whenever I need to do important/formal transaction I need to open internet banking instead of just use the app.
I can forgive if an app is slow, but this app is downright unusable. App takes forever(literally never ending time) to load and would sometimes crash mid transaction. Hopefully there will be a new version of this app that can go toe to toe with competitors.
It's really frustrating that lately it's taking so damn long to load the app.. at first i though it was a problem with my internet connection but all of my friends that are using this app also experience the same thing.. idk what's wrong with the system but please fix it.. it's hard to use cashless payment method if it's always taking so long to load like this..
Latest system makes my bill payments delay because I need to be logged out for some time before I can log in again in another application. Quite a hasle. If it is for safety reasons, I think your team need to figure out other way around. Not everyone have the leisure to make bills payment on separate occasions.
This app is a fail. Not just it takes too long to load every pages, its not even functioning well. I once make a interbank transfer and the status is pending! I tried again using website and it works fine. So i had to call the customer service to report about it and it took almost a week to get refund. Worst experience ever. I should've stick to using website.
Please upgrade or update your system. System lag and work very slowy even with high speed internet. Very difficult to make online transactions. Mine always has system error and i cannot log into my account. It has been continuing for few month already. Getting security code is also a problem as i was always getting late msg.
After reading several previous previews, I personally endured the same problem which is, unable to log in using the apps. Seems like no improvement to curb the problem. Another issue which I noticed is that using the internet banking method, the steps are confusing. Why can't you simplify ways and methods.
This apps stop working since 1week right when we need most! It keeps showing SERVER ERROR no matter I use WiFi or mobile data! Before that, this apps was not "internet friendly" bcoz it only needs high speed mobile data instead of basic data. However,even I used WiFi still not working and only 1@2 times,I can use after waiting more than 10mins loading!! And now, completely not working! I wish I can give zero star to this apps.
After updating the apps, I cannot log in to my account as the server keep saying unable to connect to the server which is very inconvenient. This is not the first time it happens but almost every time when update the apps. It's not ok as the apps should be more better to user after updating not making it worst. Really sad though.
Always unable to access into this apps with error msg appeared as "due to high traffic". I suppose the bank should be happy and expecting the high traffic as the mark of trust from the user. Please fix it.. to be honest, both apps and website version. I have headache with both today, and customer service always unreachable due to the high numbers of call.
Your app is poorly optimised and not efficient to be used. Apps takes more than a minute to open up. It takes extra minutes just to do a simple transaction. Sometimes, it logout without my consent (While using the app). Please improve and see how other competitors have better mobile apps experience. 🙄 I m complaining because I was forced to use this bank because of my scholar and I don't like the experience so far.
After recent update (date of update release 11/11/2022), the app can't be access at all and it been days, days that it shows "Server error" failure even though my data connection is stable and all. Repeating the step to try again doesn't matter because the same error window keep popping and restrict access into this app. Thankfully your website doesn't crash like this tho but still 🙁
"unable to connect to the server" this thing happen so many time. should repair it immediately or just throw this apps. how many times to clear cache as you said but things happen badly i still cannot login and the same message appear "unable to connect to server". trying to uninstall and reinstall but same problem occur. really dissappointed
The app is always unstable. It took too much time to load and sometimes it couldn't open at all. Please fix it. Things that were supposed to be done easily & quickly will turned out to be a complete disaster. I like to go cashless so I need the app to be available easily all the time
Thing is, I had great difficulty to establish whether this is a legit app or not. I only noticed the previous version was no longer functioning and found this Go app in the Play store. Checked in BIMB website and still no mention of this new app superseding the old one. My advise to BIMB is to be more professional when handling digital content. Make an official announcement in the website about any new digital app or way of handling.
Couldn't log in since about a week ago. Got 'unable to connect to server' error. Tried many times on different days. Same problem. Cleared cache, cleared data, same problem. Uninstalled, reinstalled fresh with the latest version, still couldn't log in. Please advise a solution ASAP as I see many other users facing the same problem. I am using Android.
I've been using this app for 2+ year or so, no problem that really concern me before beside some little bug, but after a several update last year this apps is useless, always loading at the start up screen, now i cannot use duitnow transfer, this happen to me when i'm at supermarket queing to pay my groceries but the apps won't load at all, now i have to go to atm machine to withdraw cash, please fix this problem fast!
Its very frustrating, the system always down, the apps always have problem to scan the qr code or even to log in. Recently, when using the visa card to pay, it deducted twice even the transaction is unsuccessful and it not only happened to me but happen to my other family and friends. Please do better to maintain your customer loyalty
Yesterday I installed it in my phone and it performed well. But today it suddenly freezes out and I can't login to my account. Whenever I've already entered the password and proceeded, it shows my account loged out. I tried to uninstall and install it back but it works the same. I tried using the online banking website and it surprised me by telling that I don't have user account. Today is a Sunday and the branches aren't working, so I would have one day without transactions? What a big trouble!
Having problem to access my acc. The app kept loading and giving notification to use web. But when i tried login through web, it says i am already logged in due to the app despite the app already been closed. Tried to go back to the app, i got access denied! Been in constant loop going back and forth. This is very frustrating! The app got worst upon update.
Couldnt open the apps. Delayed all my tasks. New comments: I noticed that the problem occurs when I use wifi. Once I switched to my mobile data the apps works just fine. Wonder why. I hope the developer can look into this issue. Thanks Another new comments: app asked for udpates. After updates needs to re-register. Continue to fail to register after more than 5 attempts (tries in different days and time, install uninstall, restarting phone). Please, can developer do something about it...
As the apps ALWAYS server error, I decided to use the web instead.. Unfortunately, any online transaction i need to approve via this non-functional app too. In the end, I need to opt for another banking account instead. It's time to terminate my account, i guess. What's the point if the online platform can't be used during this digital era.
13/1/23-Endless loading when i opened the app. Might be because the new update, at least around that time. . . 15/1/23-Work okay so far after reinstall it. For others who did not know, the app only work on single device. In my case, I used the app on multiple device before, and just realise it only can use on one device at a time, this maybe for user security too.
After update the apps, worst and the apps is very hasle and time consuming to deal with. Apps keep crashing and always appear "unable to connect" and take time for login. Feel very dissapointed and frustating to us while using this apps. Each time upgrade it still slow and please ensure the apps is easily convience for us to use.
This app starts to get slower and slower. Can't even share receipt to whatsapp for whatever reason. Whenever i try to scan qr code from my gallery, the app restarts itself and sometimes I can't scan my finger print for faster log in. Even if i do get to scan my finger print, it takes ages to load. I dont know why so please fix this app.
I barely can log in. The LOADİNG was always taking forever! When it does logged in, every single click to proceed with different services will take another LONG LOADİNG and most of the time I got kicked out or the time sessions expired before I could complete them! 😔 Please do fix it or I have no option but use another online banking 🙃!
The transition is a bit slow & login with biometric also slow. I wish that the app will improves the swiftness of transition from one page to another & also, i hope it never neglect user's security in all aspects. Keep on improving.
Salam. I faced the problem in log in. After key in the correct User ID, the apps seems crash and instantly back to phone menu. I do refer to the nearest branch and contact center but they could not give a solution to the problem. They always said to have up to date apps n for sure i did update the apps. The branch officer said mybe my phone the old version phone n the storage was full....hellooooo!!! I dont have any problem with my acc as i still can access via browser but cant do in bimb go.
Website is much more stable to use, and more reliable. Now the server is down, and I don't know why. I like using it to do transfers and DuitNow QR, even checking balance often. Please fix this soon. But the SecureGO is inconvenient, I had a crash once and I cannot approve payment. Maintain the SMS codes for the website, unless the transaction is through the app.
I got kicked out from the apps when I try to log in. And ive been trying for many times. I think it's not just me, everyone else also face the same problem. Please fix this. It's troublesome to use the website but that's the only option since this apps does not works well. Thanks
I cant share the pdf of my transaction, i thought it was just a bug, that will be fixed after an updates, already went through 2 updates but still not fixed? There also no sections for troubleshooting or somewhere that let u ask when u have a problem with the app. The app was fine until i cant download my pdf. Its just too inconvenience to people using the app.
Couldn't log in to this app, and apparently there's update available. Tried to update but pending for hours. So I uninstalled the apps, restart my phone and tried to re-install. But until now it's still pending installation. I don't have any problem updating/installing other apps. So now I don't even have the apps, and have to login in web version
Was working fine until one day it just decided to give up on me. I can't access my account It just gives me a loading screen. I thought reinstalling it might help, but nope. Now it just shows me the Get Started page every time. When I click on it, only blank screen is shown.
Very bad. Everytime open the apps, the system will loading and buffering. In one day this happens quite all the time. Problem is transaction above RM200 needs secure confirmation from the apps but the apps cannot be openned. WORST WORST WORST internet banking apps. Please improve otherwise people will not put money in your saving account.
The performance is really bad. It always dissapointed to open the app as almost all the time it was not function. Already reinstall to many times, but it still same after a few days. Please make it the performance as previous. Previously, it was really easy to access this apps.
I have worst experience with this new updated apps. I already update my phone, my phone is still new. Already clear cache. Already switch to mobile data or wifi but i still experiencing loading error and server error. I dont how to give feedback anymore. Already uninstall and install it back but still doesn't solve the problem that i experienced. You guys have to take this seriusly 😌 if you want to make an apps you have to make sure it user friendly and usable. Dont make us frustrated
Unable to open the apps at all after setting up on the phone. Everytime have to install and reinstall. When i use the website, require the GO aunthentication, but cannot open the apps. Keeps on loading and crashing. Before this the apps is more stable. Please fix this fast. Its so hard to do transaction.
Had problem login with fingerprint, developer responded to reenable the Quick Touch and it works now. On another matter, there's a lot of work to be done if they want to compete with other mobile banking apps but for its current iteration, I think it's quite good.
What is wrong with this app? I've been using bank Islam for a year now but only the previous version worked and not the latest one😡 It kept showing server and stuck on loading screen everytime I opened it! I also uninstall and reinstalled it several times but still not working😡👎🏻 what the heck?(edit: Now it became extremely slow😡 why?! So annoying!!)
Lagging. Takes too long to even open the apps. Even if it's not peak hour or date or whatever. Biometric fingerprint doesn't usually available. An app is supposed to be convenient and efficient. You lack both.
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME! A month & counting, no progressive updates from developer! I've tried everything you asked for, reinstall the apps but nothing works. Quite a shame, overall quite friendly but not really reliable as to date. Please remove the function of verification via Go if you're not addressing this problem yet. Really wish this can be fix ASAP.
What happen? After logged in, always error pop out.. I've been cleared all the cache many times, uninstall everything and start again.. Yet the issue still happening. This is the worst banking apps ever.. Please get your technical team fix this for the convenience of other customer. You should hire a better apps developer team!
The app is not useful at all as it always crashes or keep loading for a long time. The developer is keep stating that they're improving the app but there's no improvement till now. We as a user can't use the app to do any kind of transaction during emergency time also.
I cannot even open the app. I uninstalled and reinstalled multiple time but it's all the same. I cannot open the app. It keeps loading. I cannot do fund transfers because I am told to approve the transaction on the app, but I cannot open the app. This happened too many times. Do something about the app. Or give us an option for the IAC when we want to do fund transfers
The time taken to load the app was too long and its very inconvinient when I try to make transactions using QRpay. Please improve the user experience as it is used by so many people. Or just try to make a whole different app that's better in every way. Looking foward to that.
Copy & paste function is not available. This is one of the most important features need to be added. The UI/UX design also got problem ; the contrast etc. pls look back at the basic principles of design.
Updated the apps few weeks back and now am not able to screenshot my transaction anymore. I get that we can share it, but if I forgot then there's literally no way to just get them anymore from the app. I need to open in browser and screenshot from there. So much work to do and very annoying.
I wanted to fund transfer to another account. But at the very last page, the app doesn't cross check and display the official name of the recipient account? It simply trusts the recipient's name I put whilst trasnferring? It's terribly unreliable and unsafe. Unproffessional and unbelievable.
Ive been using this app for like half a year or so. Everything was fine until last two days, it required an update so i did and suddenly the app started to take a longer time to respond and open. Not only that, after the loading, it crashed. I feel so mad about this because we already in an era where qr code banking is a must but an app which must fulfill the needs does not function well. Im disappointed.
Worst app ever. Its been 2 months i've tried to access the app but connection server error has been appearing. Please get ur server fixed. It is not user friendly at all. I have to keep on going to the bank to do certain transaction which this was suppose to be made on online instead.
It's been more than a month i still could not login into the app even though after i had uninstall and install it back repetitively. The app keeps on showing error all the time which makes it difficult for me to go cashless. Please fix this as soon possible.
Worst banking app ever. Just opening the app your greeted with loading screen with an infinite loading time. After that when you try login your account you will have to wait again with the loading screen. Your lucky if you even manage to log in even twice a day without any problem. The app is slow when just about to do transaction, QR payment ot changing the settings. Reinstall and clearing the cache is obviously not working. So overall worst banking app ever.
Stuck at loading screen, clear cache then ok for a bit but then stuck again. Why do i need to clear cashe every damn time? DuitNow qr will need to reset transfer limit everytime clear cache. Duitnow qr camera is distorted as if the camera is squeezed. Qr detection is garbage, the scanner will show error message when im not even scanning anything, clicking OK on errror pop up will pop up another failed to scan error message. I only use this app to transfer with duitnow and I cant even do that
Worst experience ever. This is my first time downloading this app. I can't log into the app. The app will turn off or kick me out the app after i try to submit my password.. I tried updating my phone and somehow it worked, I can enter the app, but another problem emerge😅. When I use qr code, it says that i dont have any bank account even though i have one. It even suggested me to register my bank account.
So tired.. the apps keep crashing and it's currently unavailable. When they first release the apps, there's minor problem and it's inconvenient to transfer money but the issue is fixed now. But then now the apps keep crashing and I'm a disappointed user
Cant even log in to the app after last update. Keep saying unable to sync cant connect lah apa lah. Very bad. Such a shame because the app itself is good enough. Just the recent unable to log in stuff so if cannot lon in then what use is an app? I see everyone also struggling with this issue not just me. Fix before i change to another bank
Problem after updating the Apps. Before, i'm not having any problem with the app, but yesterday, after updating the apps, pop up 'unable to connect the server' showing up. No matter how frequent i turn off & restart my handphone, it is still the same. It's getting annoying as i need to make money transaction asap. Preferably i don't want to use the website as i want to transfer to other bank immediately. Please....fix this Bank Islam Go.....
I can't even make a proper transaction without the app lagging on the other end. The app used to be good and was easier to login. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app because it said 'unable to connect to server'. I hope this bug will be fixed as soon as possible.
The loading screen took so long. I can't even enter the login page, yet when I tried to login it will took so long to loading results to " We're having bad traffic " pop-up shown multiple times. Very bad app for multi billionaire company, even the beginner devs can do better application than this one.
Whenever I try to open the app, the words 'Unable to connect to server' pops out and I've been disappointed ever since. Why doesn't it work? Well, that's for the team to figure out and for us to wait in anticipation. So it's best if you GO and do it. Get it? GO and do it? No? Ok. Still frustrated with the app tho. 1 star, very bad.
Another hassle. A whole more inconvenient. You think i need more apps in my phone when a browser can do pretty much everything. No instructions how to start and i can't even get past the login page. Give a damned instructions, a simple one so the not so it savvy can do it too.
The worst and stupidest banking app ever. Logging in takes forever and sometimes can't even logged in. Error messages pop up here and there. Super slow make heart boil everytime I use the app. Why bother develop an app when customer can't even have ease of heart using the app. Worst experience. Period!!!
Currently very very annoyed right now. It has been two days! I cant transfer using the app, and if i want to transfer using the web, they ask to get the verification via the app?? U can just ask for tac no! Two days im stuck!!!! Helloooooo i have bills to pay meney to transfer!!! The apps stated "system is currently unavailable, please try later" and proceed to state " the connection is not secured, request cannot be secured" seriously what kind of connection are u referring to???!!!! Fix this
The app gets very buggy starting on November and I'm always stuck at the loading screen (before the login one). I have uninstalled it once and reinstall it again, but still the problem persists. Fix your app Bank Islam if you really want us users to ditch the web version of it. Even the web version I can't get a receipt after any kind of payment
Current update not working. Everytime I enter the apps, a pop up saying server error occured. This has happened since the last update and I have not be able to login using the apps since then. Please fix the current update so that there will be no more inconvenience later.
The apps is too easy to installed and user friendly. In term of security is quite weak. The most bad thing about this app, it's always have unstable connection, i was unable to access it for few days since its failed to connect to server. 🥲🥲
After the update, it took me few minutes to log in. I open other online bank apps and its working fine. So it's not my internet problem. After waiting few minutes to log in, it log out by itself a few seconds after i log in. It's better to log in into their system via chrome or Firefox rather than use their app. It's hard for users to use this app when in hurry. Please fix this issue please ASAP.
This is horrible. I can't access my account. Wanted to make transaction but needed to change transaction limit, that required me to approve the change in the app but I can't even LOGIN. Uninstalled and installed back..high traffic volume pulak. Don't make an app if you can't do decent maintenance.
App always loading after update last week. Stuck at log in page. Dunno wht happen. I uninstalled the app n install back, the problem cannot solved. I've been use this app since last year but this latest update is so unconvinced. The app should be user friendly with high security but this app totally different. Do something please.
This app is useful but I have problem where it cant be open a lot of times. After I open it, it just keep loading. I have to uninstall and install it back everytime this happen. This could probably be the app needing an update but would like dev to prompt it instead of me reinstalling it everytime. Thanks
The systems are really bad , poor & slow. Seriously , slow to access. Please do update/upgrade. Really bad. Even , i can't log in into my own account it keeps loading. Need some improvement for this. Really disappointed. Today , I've topup for my friend my money has been deducted but he haven't received the topup yet , it shows Succesful but NADA. Hope will see changers without clashing. Thank you 😣
Clearing the cache and reinstalling does nothing, I still cannot access the app since the latest update version. And I had no problem with my WiFi connection. Pls revert back to older version if the newer version is not ready.
Everything with this apps or bank seems to be delayed. Fund transfer has been delayed because of weekend as it is IBG, top-up reload has been delayed because of unknown reason. Been waiting like crazy, if I know about this, it must be much faster to just take out the money from the ATM and settle all of my things at once. Installing this to makes life easier, but seems like that's not the case. Very disappointed.
Interface hard to understand. I want to delete my previous fav acc but cant find the button. I want to direct debit into my TH acc. First, I do it on website but restricted and advised I should download GO apps. Try on apps but cant find the page. Hard to navigate. The only easy one is to transfer money. If I want to managed my acc, its hard to done it on apps. Useless
The most buggy app that I had ever encountered. Slow to start, login problem with error "unable to connect to the server". The only reason I had to install this is because the need for verification from the app for fpx payment. PLEASE, just send TAC code to mobile number instead of needing to use this horrible app. New edit : Is the server for this app even up? I kept having issues with "cannot connect to the server". Seriously just get rid of this trash app if so lazy to maintain the app.
1) No way to make transfer to accounts other than favourite account. 2) Furthermore, addition of a favourite account is not possible through the mobile app, there is no relevant selection to authorise the addition even after being directed from the online banking website. Perhaps a more user friendly way to authorise the addition of a fav account is by sending a code to a verified phone number or email address. Please resolve both issues asap as the app is not user friendly at all at this point.
It is so not convenient. Why bother making an apps if I have to go back to website to add fav acc then go back to apps for transfer? The apps should make it able to all acc. And today I tried to make a transaction to my fav acc list but the transaction is pending. Idk. Maybe it is under maintenance or what?? The money already deduct from acc. It just the process is pending. Help me out. Thanks!
Latest update (Jan2022) - I'm having problem on opening the app from the start. It's weird the app ask me to update to the latest version but when I clicked the UPDATE button it jumped to my playstore and it shows no update since I've set it auto-update. Then, I press BACK, the app seems blank and can't use it at all. Please fix this ASAP. This is getting me worried since I have to check my account frequently.
Good for a start, and alhamdulillah finally what I've been waiting for since first I registered for bank islam. Thank you very much to the developers team on doing this. As I've gone through the reviews, the supports and developer are actively communicating back to the users, so that's a star from me. My comments for the interface is, based on my experience, it's better to have that More Options (six dots in the bottom right corner) to be placed alongside the top-up options on the bottom menu.
I never leave a review on Google Play, but this one, I feel obligated to make one. I have to let everyone know that this is the most useless, yet important apps I've ever download in my life! Everytime I need to make a transfer, I need to open this apps for approval. Yet, the apps kept loading endlessly. Thank you for making my life miserable.
We have to reinstall everytime when need to use this app to get the infinite login loading bugs away. This is the worst app for online banking. And no, don't tell us to reinstall or clear cache or any kind of self troubleshoot ever again. Just go fix your bugs already. 🤦🏻‍♀️
Very poor. Really disappointing because couldn't use it when there's an emergency to do the online transaction.. I even can't open the app it's always showing that server error for past few months.. really hoping that you will improve the system asap :⁠-⁠(
The best banking app ever. Why you might ask ? Because even me, myself couldn't get past through the loading screen, even scammers would not even get through this app too, good job, keep everyone out from entering and using the app. Edit : The suggested "Clear Cache" doesn't even help in this case, tq.
I can't see the amount of my savings in the app compared to the website...I can see the amount😭. As a beginner I totally cried a lot that there's no money in it. Then I checked on website...This app aren't user friendly at all. Please fix this😭🙏.As someone who is new to this definitely confusing ad stressful.
I have been experiencing multiple errors and technical issues with your app many times, in almost every transaction I made. Has been happening almost a year plus now. Reading through the reviews by other users, where some had written the same complaints in few year back, it is quite surprising to know that other than admitting the problems and ensuring an improvement to your customer, there is still no positive changes. Do you think this is funny?
What a worse experience using this app. Before it was stable until the recent update makes it super hard to launch app and endless loop of loading time and slow app response. Been thinking to terminate BIMB just for this app is so slow and unresponsive most of the time and I mostly use online banking this is a troublesome for me. So, please fix this app you will lose alot of your customers because of this app alone
Why the apps need to access my photo library, location, phone book and etc.? It doesn't make sense. The app won't run when these accessed were not granted. For what? Why you need to access my microphone when you don't even have a voice command function. This a banking app, not Instagram of Facebook. I have been using Maybank App and I don't need it to access my personal data and it had work seamlessly. Tell your app developer to remove all this nonsense.
Month before the app runs smoothly & superb,but all went downhill. Apps runs slow,needed few tries to get the App open,even restarting the phone,apps & clearing cache wont solve the problem! im currently using the latest update there was,no change at apps behavior.its unacceptable for good bank as yours.
The app really suck .. I can't get into the app for several days.. I tried so many times in and out but still it loading and loading without letting me into my acc. I tried to uninstall and reinstall but it still the same. Please take some action bcause I could not even access to my account to make transfer
Hi, why the recent updates makes this app even worst ya? Already tried install and reinstall many times. The outcomes still same the page is blank at the good evening and stuck there like forever! Before this i used to like this app the most easy and smooth to do transaction.
This is the most horrible app I've downloaded and I'm easily impressed. It takes too much time to load that affects my payment process. It always says "access denied" for no reason so I have to reinstall it again and again. Please pay attention to this and fix it asap.
Suddenly stopped working. I re-installed many times. After the get started screen, it get stuck on the Good Morning page forever. I have called your customer service but is of no help. They say reinstall again! I am stuck. Please help resolve this matter asap. Thank you.
App frequently crashes, after initial login. Example, i install the app, login, then use it. Then next time when i try to use it, it would crash; unable to login unless if i clear the data. But it would be redundant to clear data everytime i need to use the app. Prefer old app before update. Much stable
Not functional on my device at all , a thousand times uninstall and reinstall just get the same thing , always crash i don't know why , if i want to make a transaction must go to the browser , what the function of the app if i can't use it , please recheck your system app so every phone can use it , thank you....
Every time I click on the app, it takes a VERY long time to connect. Sometimes it doesnt connect at all.. The red blob just keeps swirling around forever.. Internet online banking is even easier to connect..
Dear developers, recently i have faced this app issue that it won't let me go through the ''get started '' button,and it stuck ,and sometimes its keep loading till next day,i need u all solve this problem ASAP!! Im using that for paying my tuition fees and now things get harder for me,unlike the website works fine,but for me the app is more convenient..... please make it work again n fix the bug...
Cannot share receipt after transer transaction. It happen twice to me. At first I'm okay. But after 2 week. I make transaction. Still the same problem. When try to share the transaction receipt. Got noti "PDF is not downloaded" . Very fatal bug. Have checked update. But there is no update at all. Please fix this!
Too many bugs. The app is convenient once you get to use it. But everytime I want to use it, I have to redownload the app. If not, the app will stuck at loading page forever
I dont know what happen to the previous version since it stopped working for me stating 'cannot connect to server'. Updating the app wont work, you need to uninstall it and install it again, by then it should work.
Worst banking app I've ever used. So damn slow to log in or use QR until at some point I even had to borrow my friend's phone to pay for stuff (happens in more than 1 occasion). It's so embarrassing. Time to terminate my account and activate maybank instead because obviously the developers of this app couldn't care less about the users. You make things difficult for a lot of people and we don't have time to deal with trash app like this. PS I've tried deleting cache bla3, still no use.
Very bad. I have tried to add favourite account. Always telling me to go to bank islam go. I logged in and nothing happened. Tried to find add new favourite account. Couldnt find it. This happened a lot of time. Please add the feature. I find using othet banks apps are much easier than this one.
I don't even know whats the problem about your apps... Its truly useless that's what i can say... Im installed this apps for many time but still fail to get started because of invalid credentials... I don't know where got wrong i'd wrote user id, password, and ic number without any wrong but still invalid... I can't make transaction at the website because of large amounts and i have to download this app... But this app are not usable at all...
Hi, I have used this app for quite some time & have not encountered any problems until recently... my transaction made from awfar account a few days ago was still pending until today. I have checked the other party account & it still has not received its intended amount, but at the same time the amount has been deducted from my awfar account. How can this be?
Lousy & terrible apps ever. BIMB expect us to authorize payment using this apps rather than key in TAC. But almost impossible to login to this apps because of server/connection issue continuously happen. BIMB left us with no other option & alternative. It's time to close our BIMB account & better use other bank services.
When i connect to wifi, i can access this application. But when i use my data, i can't even login. At the same time, i try also with cimbclick application by using data, i can login easily. Please fix this ASAP because i think this problem had occurred for the past several month. Please improve!
Personally, I think this app is much better than using in Google Chrome, since the website much friendlier for PC based users. Don't let other bad comments fool you, the app is great. Try it yourself, if not maybe the problem is with you not the app. Easy to conduct, I can manage favourite account and paybill (jompay) much easier than before instead of open my Laptop for the prpcess.
PLEASE DO SOMETHING REGARDING YOUR BUG, it kept on stuck loading at the very first page. I've uninstall and reinstall twice. It only fine for a couple of days and then kept on going back to load forever to the point I had to uninstall it.
Others are quite nice, needs a little improvement. But money transfer is not secure, can access with just password, needs TAC just like website or at least fingerprint plus password. Security needs so much improvement.
Probability to get a successful login is 1/100. It's taking forever to login to secure transaction. Always unsuccessful. Rarely succeed. Server error. Network error. All sort of errors. Favourites account not tally from website and GO apps. Better go learn from maybank & upgrade, far better & smoother.
Started from 3-4 weeks ago, everything about this are horrible, before that its all good, first thing, sometimes i cant even open app? Its doesn't even loading you know. Second, even its already opened, its so slow really slow and a bit laggy. Thirdy, when i need to pay(scan qr code) omg that where i hate it so much, because you see i already in front of the counter and i cant open my app? Like wth? How do i suppose to complete the transaction? Please be responsible and fix this problem.
Unable to log into the apps. Been installing and uninstalling but still didn't work. I'm resorting to access via web for now until the apps is stable again. Hopefully I won't be pushed into making verification through apps. That would be my last straw.
Please fix the bug where it's taking a very long time to even access the app. Nowadays if we need to approve or transfer some money it needs to be access through this app, and yet how can we do it if the app doesn't respond and taking a super long time to load and then crashed. Thank you.
Fix asap, transaction big amount require us to use this app, but then it does not even loading, it show require update, but after update, the app not working.. FIX THIS ASAP, it is so bad when happen during emergency .. update: this things keep on happen again , this is so baad!!
I already using this app for few years but lately the service is very bad. Cannot login at all thus i re-install the apps to my phone. So the apps is up to date. Sadly still cannot use it. It says the credentials are not usable. Can u pls help? I will give full star once this issue is settled.
after the update the apps has been consuming too much time when reloading. i've install and re-install the app but its still the same. im so frustrated when i want to use it immediately as i thought i can do the payment without using any cash!!!
There was a problem occured when I tried to update the app as required. Nothing turned out on screen so I had to uninstall it. When I try to reinstall the app, it keeps on loading eventhough I have tried so many times. I do not know what the problem is .
It has been an hour since I waited for this app to operate like usual. Have been more than thrice uninstall and reinstalled. Usually it took seconds to reach login page but this time took minutes which is very annoying. When got to click the get started, it appears a white blank interface with only bank islam's logo and good evening even when clicked at the back arrow it did nothing. Please fix this asap!
It become worse after the update, can't even login. Even if you say try to reinstall the app, the problem still there. Its been couple of months already since last year and the problem still not fix. If can i will give 0 star for this app bcuz if u cant login what's the point? It did fix after reinstall but only once... Then should i reinstall everytime i want to use this app?? What a joke. Better go learn making app 1st bcuz even simple app dev can fix login problem a few days later...
Try to login then loading for about 5 minutes still couldn't login. Then tried again for about 5 times, but still the same situation. Really INCONVENIENCE. Just heightened my stress level. Do upgrade for a much better version since the website informed to use this apps for any transactions.
As of Nov 11th 2022 update, I STILL cannot open the app at all because of 'server error' pop up at launch. Vivo 1906 android version 11 that is up to date. Updated to the 30th of Nov. More than two weeks and still not working.
I've been trying to log In my Bank Islam account using this apps since Sunday 19/2/2023. But it keep asking me to deregister my phone. I've try to install and uninstall. But it still the same. I've tried to deregister as the task given. After I key in the TAC number, it keep loading more than a minute. And it keep going like that for 3 days now. Please how can I fix it.
Hi there. Just suggesting, if one feature could be added, to have a split or partition account for us to customise, from the acc balance. E.g, 'Tabung 1, Tabung 2, Sewa Rumah, Loan Kereta'. . Because, some transferring/receiving money method are by using this app. And it is a big relief for us, if we could use from the acc bal, without misused the reserved amount for commitments. Hope you guys could add this feature. I'm really appreciate, and thank you very much.
Really bad and miserable experience which involves bugs and asked me to login tons of time where my username and password already correct. I dont know whats the issue which leads me to finally have to reset my password at the Internet Banking website which is the whole different purpose from why Im getting the apps. Well, maybe i just going to stick with the website only in fact thats better anyway..
Worst experience ever. The apps can't respond after I install the new version. Didn't support high user. Server not responding it take 2 days to login. Better than website. But now some transaction from website need approval from the apps. Its freaking me out. Make sure when you want to delpoy the latest version do the testing process first. What I can say is this app not helping me out with my daily life. Argh 😤.
For the last 3 years if using this app. I would give it 5/5 for "the app actually worked". For the last few months (new update) the app is straight down broken that I was forced to transfer my funds to tiger bank because the qr pay for that app actually works. I guess the devs be like "it's a feature, not a bug" since it saves your money by preventing you from spending it lmao
So, this is version 3.2.03 of the GO app? The latest yet the worst of it, huh? I deleted the previous one, installed it as the Bank advises, but it does not open at all. It's always 'Server Error... unable to connect to the server.' Now, I can not use the app at all, a confirmation of my conviction that the app progressively becomes unusable. If there's anything disappointing about Bank Islam is its GO app 😔.
App is absolutely terrible. Server always down despite having less features compare to other bank apps. Such basic app but having errors here and there constantly. I hope the developer improve their app ASAP because people nowadays prefer to use phone to transfer money and others to get things done instantly.
Seriously what are you guys doing there? I've installed and uninstalled this piece of app but still can't access my acc. can't even pass the registration!? even after closing the app it ask me to registered again and again and again, I had enough! I'm on android 12, I've clear cache many time and still nothing this had been happening since last year but it's getting worse now, smh
What is the actual problem of this apps?? I've tried install many times but still not working (keep loading). Previous one is better. Almost 2 weeks i cannot use the apps & the website cannot sharing transaction receipt, need to screen shot everything... What happened? Bank islam need to noticed all the complaints recently & fixed it urgently... Tq
I had no trouble using the app before. Since the newest update, the app always unable to open. Really bugged me when I wanted to make a quick transfer or make payment to merchants. PLEASE FIX THE PROBLEM ASAP!!
I don't know what is going on with the app developer. It seems like the update makes the app broken. I can't even open the app to approve any transaction, and neither can I receive sms TAC as alternative. I hope BIMB can fix the app soonest or even open back sms TAC as backup alternative. BTW, I am on the 3.2.03 version..and please dont tell me to reinstall or clear cache to get it work cause I did it and it doesnt work..i recommend that BIMB to change the app developer to get this sorted out.
Changing from 3 to 1 star. It's freaking horrible. It requested us to uninstall and install back to update app, it doesn't work at all after that. Cannot login. It gave various nonsense error. From null exception to whats not. If like this, how can I convinced this app is secure?
I cant login after i logout for the first time using this app. I tried to uninstall and reinstall it still the problem remain unsolved. Can u gais do something regarding this issue? Please. Edited: now the app cant be loaded. Due to connection problem, yet my internet is just fine. Mind to fix it? I like using it since it can share transaction receipt. And for reference, it happened after i updated the app to the latest version. Please do something bout it.
Your app can only be labeled as a terrible experience for customers. You cannot fix the slow app opening as the app sometimes goes lag and make me cannot use it for qr payment. Just remove it if you cannot do a better job in developing an excellent app, just like another bank. You also make a requirement for installing the app; the android version must be 9.0, which I can say is absurd. Please explain why your customer still needs to be stuck with your service when they don't work as they should
I agree with the other users, the apps is actually quite nice but it often showed 'server error' when you want to use the apps especially after updating it. I need to redownload it again just to avoid the error and thats sucks honestly if it happen again i guess i'll quit using it cause its annyoing and if you are not a patient person i recommend you don't download this apps just use the website cause it better.
I have problem, cant open it due to cannot connect to server. Already reinstall but still the same. Please do something bout the apps. Users shouldnt be doing reinstalling apps actually. It all depends on how you guys fix it from main office.
I think apps make transaction to be easy, but this app make transaction to become difficult. Please erase this app, let us make transaction manually from website. Every transfer must permission from go secure, but when i open this apps, its buffering so long. I miss i-access send from message.
The fingerprint access is too slow, waited for the whole 2 minutes just to access my account, and it appears to be going on forever so I close the app. You might want to check your fingerprint access system.
'Unable to connect to server' for more than 2 weeks now. Today I reinstall the app, initially it denied my access due to 'heavy traffic'. Now I can finally log in. Perhaps it's finally fixed? Please don't let this happen again. Thanks.
Worst app ever. Might as well close down my account in this bank. Need to do some transfer, app cant open. Tried to use the website, require approval thru the app. How to solve this never ending cycle? Use other bank. And this been going on for so many years, no improvement despite all the bad reviews. 0 star should be an option.
THE APPS NOT ABLE TO CONNECT. SAME GOES TO ONLINE BANKING. ERROR --> YOUR ACCOUNT NUMBER NOT CORRECT (EVENTHOUGH THE NUMBER WAS CORRECT). TRANSACTION UNSUCCESSFUL.
Wanted to change my mobile number on bank islam account and here's what I've been through: - can't change on atm now apparently. - person on the counter can't do it either, asked me to call hotline. - person on hotline can't do it either, asked me to download apps. - downloaded the apps and it keeps saying server error. This level of incompetent is just astounding. Fix it already! It's been days.
Already spent more than 1 hour still cannot transfer money. When I login through web, this GO got conflict session. When I successfully (hardly) login into GO, my web session end. You should make it opt in whether to use GO. At least when GO got bugs, ur clients can still do transactions
I am absolutely outraged with this app. When I tried to log in today, the app displayed an error message stating that the server was down. This is completely unacceptable and a waste of my valuable time. My experience with this app has been incredibly unsatisfactory and unacceptable. I demand that the bank takes prompt and effective action to rectify the server problem and provide its customers with reliable and efficient services.
12/11/22-11.25 am Was asked to update but after update error occured-unable to connect to server (even after i turned off the phone and re-open) Bank Islam FB page also didnt provide helpful solution-many other users experienced the same thing and admin only asked to uninstall and re-install) Those who tried uninstalling and re install still face same problem. Very bad user experience!
i've install this app because i thought i can do things easier with online banking. but under some circumstances i need to uninstall the app. when i forgot my id or password there is no option to recover it. i tried to go on the website but it unable to process the request. i've sent emails but only to be answered by a bot that doesn't not even helping? i even tried to call the number using every option possible (from the email and from website). all i got is no answer at all
always unable to open..already reinstall the apps but still same..please improve your apps service!!! for the answer from your cs:- i already do the cache cleaning in apps storage but still same..before this new update,your apps don't have any problem..able to open many times..you can see all rating user give to your apps..not me at all..
Wrost apps ever! If i can give 0 star, i would love to give you 0 star. Cannot login to the apps. It has been more than 1 months this apps have problems to login. Please please please update this apps. **REPLY TO DEVELOPER: I ALREADY CLEAR CACHE, BUT NOTHING CHANGE. STILL CANNOT LOGIN. I ALSO TRY UNINSTALL AND INSTALL AGAIN, IT WORKS FOR THE FIRST TIME LOGIN. BUT AFTER LOGOUT AND TRY TO LOGIN AGAIN, IT STUCKKKK AND CANNOT LOGIN. PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM
Pleaseee fix this 'access denied, server error, Traffic high'. Bad ɓad experience since nowdays with this app.. I aspect this one was good n smooth apps but make me annoyed now. When I want to log in always show ' access denied, traffic high, server error' , laaaa apa laaaa....I want to do payment very hard la using this apps, very slow, need to wait another days after others people already finished their money, then I can access...Please pleaseee fix this ASAP.
before this, after doing transaction I can download the pdf file. but recently, when I tried to download the pdf it only displayed 'pdf is not downloaded'. not sure what went wrong. udpate : thank you for the assistance. it worked.
Updated this app only for it to be completely useless. I can't even enter the app without being informed of server error. I had tried other banking apps and they worked just fine unlike this one. Such a waste of time, data sucking and inconvenient app
The worst bank app ever. What I despise the most is go secure. Payment would not go through 9 out of 10 times after it's approved in go secure. What's the point of having that function if its not gonna function most of the time. Do better. Bring back tac.
Unable to open the app after I updated to the new version. "unable to connect to server" very annoying. I've been using this app since 2016 without any problem but now its useless.
Until the recently update, sometimes the app show unusual reaction. Like when I want to transfer the screen goes erratically (like a tv when the signal is no good). Will this lead to potential hacked.
Bad. I still cannot see what is the apps could do. It still at the getting started page and stay there. Nothing happen. I thought I got scammed. Understood the situation only after looking at all the feedback. Please upgrade/improved.
Please do something and improve the service. Always have an error when want to open it, it is not applicable if I could only open it by 2-5 am only if any other hour the reasons is high traffic and if I only I could open it by that time. Other than that there are always issue with the server.. Please bank islam do improve your service on the app. I have already install and uninstall this app few times cause of the bug.. Do help us and give us the best user experience.. Thank you
Delete/Modified favorites account on browser required verification confirmation from apps Go by Bank Islam. Your apps have such limited function. Perform delete favourite on browser but required approval from apps Go, after login apps, browser automatically logout??? Useless and no improvement until now. Such annoyed and wasting time. Better replace with TAC sms code rather than your slow response apps!
Too much bug, often stuck in loading screen, sometimes cannot open and have to wait for hours and hours, i wonder which high school kid you hired as developer and IT technician for this apps, dont you ever think if the user sometimes in emergency or urgent? absolute worst and disappointing.
??? after update the app wont go past the loading screen so i uninstalled and installed again. when i try to register and putting in the code thingy, an error popped up, "400 bad request". why is that? i have been uninstall-install for so many times now and it is still the same. would be glad if someone reached out and help me.
Overall i really like to use this apps. But, all of a sudden, my transaction status were pending. Its annoying because you guys already deduct my money, then i need to wait for hours and even days even when i use INSTANT TRANSFER. Its not the first time that this happens. We expect better than this.
It keeps loading. Usually the loading time to open this app took a few seconds. Now, it just loads and I can't use the app. Tried uninstall it and reinstall. After I click get started, it only direct me to a blank page. Please fix this.
Not effective system especially you want to transfer money, I don't mind authenticating many times, but oftenly go apps loading is tooooo slowwww to approve transcaction. Then you have to repeat the whole process of payment again due to time limit.
This apps is malfunctioning for almost a week now. I could not access through my phone. Error pops up saying can not connect to the server each time I try to log in. What happens actually? Please fix immediately!
Cannot access acct today. Why??? This was my review on Jan-22. The issues still existed and even worst. This apps used to be very good, but since last year until now, this was the worst banking apps existed. I have to uninstalled and installed it again and again just to use the apps. Gonna move my money to other bank!
Good. but don't make us to open the apps for verification if we're transferring money from a computer. Because the apps is too slow to open. the apps is not ready for that. just do it with SMS
The application is very bad, there is always a problem when trying to log in.. Logging in to google is still the same, even worse he says I have a wrong id or password, your internet banking account has been disabled and please reset your password, this is a joke or what, It's the third time I've changed my password, what*******
for a simple app as compared to other online banking apps you'd expect it to run smoother. but the app is very slow, and crashes frequently. It's getting worse. Now cannot login. It's getting worse. takkan hari2 nak kena install baru babi!
I cannot login to my account using browser if i already login to the apps, eventhough the apps already automatically log out when times out. Its difficult for me to keep login back and then logout from the apps. Too much effort for a thing.
App loading was far too long and sometimes even could not open the app at all. Dissappointed as the app should be highly secured as this is banking & monetary related app. Already did the steps on clear cache etc but the issue still persist. Please really do something!
After the upgrade since 17/11 , its keep on loading everytime i need to use it. Now it says cannot connect to the server. The apps getting worse , before the upgrade its always smooth and not being so troublesome like now. Please fix it , its really frustrated.
All of my internet banking favourites account didn't appear. Just some of it. Can't select what account that I wanted. Another one, fingerprint login didn't works. It keep loading after I scan my thumb/fingers. Please improve. Update: It's works! Thank you for your respond.
This app is so terrible that I cannot even log into the app on my own account!! I've set up an account and I cannot log in because it said that I entered my password wrong but it's not wrong. When it first happened, I give it the benefit of the doubt and reset my password. At the website, my attempt at renewing my password was responded with "your new password cannot be the same as previous password". THEN WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?!?! I changed the password multiple times and nothing happens
good job for a starter, though the features are very limited, but i believe they will upgrade soon. just give it a little time, see how it goes. and also, i was looking for a way to remove/edit my favourite accounts. hope this is possible in the future, too. :)
I don't understand what is the point of authorization using the app before a transaction as I can't even log in to the app. It just keep loading. It was so annoying. If the transaction authorization by using the app is so complicated and useless, why can't just keep the previous method, just via the phone tac number?
After the latest update, app keeps on de-register my account and if need to use the app, always have to re- register. Aside to that, i can't change the security tac to send via sms instead of approval from apps. It is very inconvenient.
The apps are getting worse recently. Takes me forever to open the duitnow qr scanner. Hope recovery ASAP. Even the normal transaction is terribly slow to be accessed through the apps and bank islam biz (web version) too. So, how do you think I'll do the online transaction. Mass changing of your customer to another bank is sure a big loss for this. (Of how you handle the satisfaction of user's experience online). Please, how can't you notice how Maybank is doing great in this. Thanks in advance.
I know this app could help people make the job much easier but this app is kinda failure since the latest update come up, some of my transaction keep failing but literally took some of my money away and they told me that my transaction is on hold status but where is money go anyway ? One more wrong step to to be completely failure for this app.
I updated the app to its newest version and when i opened it, it told me can't contact to the server. I thought it was temporary like before but then i opened it again on the next day, the problem is still there. Pls fix this issue ASAP
The app really hard to open it, loading and take a long time to open it... please inprove it, before this I use still easy and fast to open it, but after upgrade really slow and take a long time to open the apps... annoying
Idk why after the recent update i can't even open the apps and it's been WEEKS. Even after uninstalling and re-installing them, still can't be connected to server. This is so annoying.
Firstly, apologies for the rude review from me last time. Bcs Im rlly pissed off last time. Now I already uninstall & reinstall the app several times but still I cannot Login. Everytime after I put in the secure code "400 Bad Request" error popped up and it doesn't log me in. Now I cannot topup my shopee/tng acc because they require the authorization from this app. This really cause an inconvenience to me and I get into trouble bcs of it. I'll appreciate it if you can help me solve this.
Same as many other reviews here, this app crash everytime when I open it, not usable at all. Pretty bad experience and they didn't manage to fix it after quite some time.
i hate this app as 1. i doubt that it logs out from my account. everytime, i will be informed that i am logged in. 2. where is the log out button? 3. in certain case, code input is directly on app, not on text message. (talk about maximum security) 4. this app is redundant! why do i have to do many things before performing a transaction?? i hate this app. there. i've said it.
Having trouble to open this app. Apps crash since few days ago. Already uninstall and install again a few times. But still the same. Not sure why. Too bad, making it hard to make any transaction. Please make some improvement.
After recent update, i can't open the apps. It showed "unable to connect to server", despite i have internet. Previously it was no problem for me. Hope you can fix this. Thanks
Extremely bad. The apps keep at loading page and stuck. I will definitely switch bank because of this poor service. I travel alot and in case of emergency this kind of poor service cannot happened. Please improve, until then I have given up using Bank Islam services.
