f0f66978-3a08-4fc7-a3eb-5807f18e65ca,Muhammad Zaini Mohd Hassan,Just wanted to let the devs know that the app was not able to connect to the BIMB server after the latest update. I tried updating, clearing cache, clearing storage and nothing works. It only worked again after reinstalling the app. I loved the app but it will be even more amazing if the GUI is more fluid, though that's just me being picky. Hopefully the next update is smooth as it's been a recurring issue. Kudos to the devs.,4
e1dddb30-da2a-497a-bff0-6da8237eb9ec,Farahin Yusmali,Please fix the app. Sometimes it takes time to load, unable to connect to server but when accessing internet banking through the browser works just fine. A few times I had to reinstall the app just to fix the server error. It annoys me because clearing cache doesn't help at all to reset the connection to server. Why is that a problem? Basically the app becomes completely useless when the error starts popping up, reinstalling is the only option. We use this almost daily now.,1
7ca458e4-cc36-42bf-b6f6-c4022aacee25,M. Noor Akmar,Previous version apps are more batter than current apps. After I updated to a new apps the apps seems having a bad issues. 1. It is hard to open, and it takes more time to open. Loading too long. 2. Even though1 managed to log in, when I choose, as an example, to transfer a money, the apps will be loaded again, and it takes a long time to load. 3. Not so friendly like before, because when I would like to check other things inside the apps, the same issue happens. Please make changes,1

38b55111-a0f6-4b36-b70a-4f3c8de16707,Ain Osman,NOT USER FRIENDLY AT ALL!!! Last review, 1 star on December 2022, until today Nov 2024, this apps does not improve much. They include fingerprint to make the access easier, but not easy at all. I can easily access to see ny account with 1 time using fingerprint eith other banking apps, but not with this app. To open each section, it loading for so long. To get approval for transaction also take some time. What's the point moving to 5G era, but your app still slow.,1
5e2ff49b-496f-497a-8efe-17745b6f2e4d,Haylee Pearl,for the past week I couldn't get pass the starting screen of the app and thus i can never access the app anymore. i have checked if there's any update but there were none and my phone meets the app requirement system. the web browser works fine but it is frustrating bc i can't use the app anymore to do instant transfers. fix this issue please this is too absurd,1
a98df813-6e9d-40ea-83ab-8c3aa26d77fe,Wan Qamarun Najmi,Cannot launch the app. Tried everything and yet the login page never appear, stucked at the front page forever. Read the latest reviews, and the developer keep on telling to update to latest version (3.2.09), which is what everyone already have update to, or use phone with android 9 and above. No solution or whatsover. Very disappointed with how little they care about clients' experience.,1
431e9028-4d86-4db1-b875-6537f99b9f33,BTS phan,The app is so slow, and it will not open at all. I have to uninstall the app and reinstall it every time i want to use the app. After reinstalling, I can only use it once. The second time I try to use it, the same thing happens, and I will have to uninstall again. After reinstalling the app, I can't make any transfers to other banks for the next 12 hours. I feel like closing my account just because of this. This app is not convenient at all. In fact, it is troublesome to the users.,1
9734606e-1789-4696-8006-8cd6d8180516,Muhammad Fakhrullah,Too many errors occuring from time to time Either not being able to log in, not able to use the QR, and even worse, not even able to open the apps even after waiting for quite some time. Had to uninstall then reinstall the app. It is annoying as you need to enter your data all over again,2
5ccadc7b-93d6-4dd5-a564-d6fff10cdf49,Ribbon Hood,PLEASE DO SOMETHING TO THE APPS!! after installed the updated version, it is always loading and stuck at the start up n i cant open the apps. Update on 28 oct 2023, i believe there is no improvement that bank islam done to their apps, which is super non friendly user, lagging, need to open and log in several times, i almost forget my password because rarely use it due to the issues.,1

3ac6a0a6-4179-495d-8751-aa2054563430,Eddy Effendy,i will close my account because if this incompetent app. now that you force to use app to validate any transfer but it does not even connect. i have clear cache, update, uninstall and reinstall before you even try to ask for me to update this app. even tried with wifi and my mobile 5G speed. this is just pure garbage of an app.,1
89390296-5a85-4154-8a9e-946345b0d98e,Amirah A Bakar,25/8/23: Guess I'm not changing my opinion anytime soon. Very, very rarely it was fast. Rest of the time? So slow that I forgot I have to pay for something. Now? I can't even go to the main page, keeps telling me to reinitiate transaction. WT--?? Like I have no life to live, is it, to wait for the app to actually work?,3
f4937d66-f27b-498e-a274-ee345d2d314f,JOE BLACK,the most stupidest banking app.. it will take forever to load. on top of that if you want to perform duitnow transfer through the browser, you still need to open your go app. it's so annoying and it really makes me angry. i have very stable internet connection. Hey bimb please learn from cimb how to operate an app.,1
265fa5d8-4dc6-46a2-80c4-ee4a133012b7,Michelle Angel,Unable to connect the server? Already update the latest version (as of 7 October 2023). Already uninstall and install again to see if it's working, but still doesn't working. If we need to call the center, every user of this app will end up calling Bank Islam. The problem is this app itself.,1
3b96250f-4777-4ae4-a03d-378ebf080242,Azim Kamal,Very disappointing experience using bank islam go, it takes forever just to get to the log in screen, not to mention the problem while scanning qr codes and many more.. what's the point of yall taking RM 13 from our bank accounts if you didn't do anything to fix the goddamn app..no one will be furious if there is a slight inconvenience for a short period of time, but this app has been giving people nothing but trouble for quite some time..please step up your IT teams,1
aca6785a-9dcc-4d7a-a3fb-5c4c0a417478,Mariani Shaffee,Why i kept getting error "400 bad request", although i already key in my correct password and id also the tac number. After that error, the app send me msg that i already registered yet unable to to log in. Please resolve this, i already uninstall and reinstall for several time.. Dear BIMB, Again this app really needs improvement. As from all customers that seems to have the same issues, we really need you to solves it fast for us to used it again.,1

Why in the world does everything need verification from the app anyway, the duitnow I get, the jompay I get, but why funds transfer too????,2
9bc38b21-0930-4b5f-bbf5-634d4ec9c21e,Alia Amir,Sometimes it's working.... sometimes NOT. It continues to buffer. So unfriendly users. In fact my phone is new, install & uninstall 3 times by now & updated the apps to the latest version. But still the SAME prob reoccurring. Fix you apps pls!,1

Requested for so many times still did not received any In case of emergency to do any transaction, this is very much troublesome. Transaction via website also need approval from GO Bimb. How to if I can't even open the apps ?,1
6afe2ca2-6810-455d-aa0f-8eaa2b1f948e,Hehettwaffle,I will be honest. This app is the worst. The loading takes too long for me to open the app. If its only a minute or two is okay but it takes 5 mintues or even more just to load? I've heard the issue is not new which proves this app is just that bad.,1
1215902f-97d1-4642-8c49-c36953414f1a,Alaina Hasan,I've already updated to the new version but still couldn't open the app.. I don't know why it cannot connect to the server. I've tried using both wifi and data but still can't open.,1
41f2d087-cbbf-4c61-abc7-ed47e3084af1,Mr Eddy,Very bad apps.. Always stuck and nothing happened after wait 10 minutes. Causing me very bad experience to transfer money using western Union and PFX with your apps. Very very very bad!!!!,1
4a01a5e4-6f11-4b67-bdd4-09e7cda3e0e3,natasya rahim,the apps are so bad, clear cache, etc, still unable to open the apps. Online transactions through the website need approval through GO secure, but nothing can be approved since the apps only trying to load the entire time,1
c469fd5d-a5d1-4a8a-b8a9-36d6d2440686,Atiqa Syazwani,Took super long to open the apps. Most of the time i gave up. Would rather transfer all my money to other banks, easier when i need to do duitnow payment at the store. Im super close to stop using this app.,1
c9b55ae9-4264-484e-997b-e894ff157052,Anisah binti Mohd Fauzie,I mean i understand that many people are using this app, but you have to accommodate good service to them. Make frequent maintenance, if u already did u have to make it even more frequent. Please people are just trying to get their transactions through and if u are wishing to keep them as customers, please improve.,2
d0b5234a-1de3-40a9-98c2-8646af62597e,pakdee pakdee,Frequently got problem to share the transaction receipt. There are 2 ways to share receipt in GO apps .... thru (menu) history mobile transaction or thru individual account transaction history. Both got blank receipt. My phone OS is Android version 13. GO apps version 3.2.09.,3
7e246918-3b1e-4f66-9b71-087e804f583f,hayati syamimi,The app was very very veryyyyyy slowwwwww!!!!!! Couldn't make any transactions with this app. I am beyond disappointed. Edit: after the recent update, there's no more slow loading so i think they deseve more star,4
a6cb3130-ce0a-4336-926e-48cd5d4d1854,Malaya FreeSpirit,i want to carry out fpx transaction. so i need to use go app to approve the transaction. and goes on loading till the last 120s of the transaction. and when i got at the login page press go secure to approve the transaction. it repeatly tell me the transaction has expired, when i still have 120s. i did a few more time with the same result till transaction have really expired. ok i give another go, i reinstall the app, reregistered it for 3 more time to do the fpx and it still waste my time,1
67191fc0-6a15-4860-bfcc-2222afee86dd,Norhanisah Nasran,From bad to worse. It was already laggy and slow before. Since the update, takes close to forever to load(my internet is running at 500mbps) . And the interface is very buggy. I can't do any transactions just an endless loop of returning to the home screen. I end up using chrome or my PC for any online transactions. Please this app really needs a major update & revamp. At a time when most things are online you might loose more customers bcoz other app(bank) are better,1
26854261-e53a-4426-8dd1-676db3459c5b,DinLite22,If there is an option to give 0 star, damn sure I'd give it without hesitation. Every time updates coming this app has become much much worse than before. Please fix your app and your server so we can log in without issue. Fix the damn issue asap or else we will port to another bank.,1
d6381c8f-5005-4b97-bf6d-3cca74de5c0d,Abah Eyan,Half an hour loading to open the apps. Very very very bad apps for such a big finance company. Please let us used the browser instead of this app.. I repeat.. Very.. Very....very very.. Bad and junk apps.,1
205ad67c-d94f-48e1-81de-4fcbc460357b,Vanesea Maie,I hate this app ever.... From September until the end of October, this app can't perform well even i have updated it... I can't do anything to my money in the bank. Already made some reports via email and call centre for this issue. Seem like no action from them.,1
c6172253-350f-4d5d-b9e7-82b9747c5676,Muhammad Yusoff Jamaluddin,Not intuitive to use. I cancelled my transfer settings and press OK on the dialog option, nothing happened, not even to the homepage. I tap on back button and the app not responding at all. Can't even find ASNB account summary or related (not transaction) but the bank have that service, really not good. Edit: No error, I wrote "Nothing happened" means I got any feedback from that? No, you didn't code any error message. That's even worst.,1
518e75cd-90e0-4592-a04e-e3da8a52858b,Amirul Shahril Azizi,Unable to login,Already clear and uninstall the app.Still get the same error. There is no more,Go secure for approve transaction purpose.It is very dangerous since no safety in online transaction. YES,this is the latest version of app.,1
f7a567c2-e0d9-4973-a7a9-117a7a0cca61,Winter Jasmine,Worst app ever exist! Very slow and u need to activate go secure even for small amount transfer. Waste of time!! Once lag, it's going to lag forever.. in the end, need to uninstall and install it again. No improvement despite people giving reviews. Don't bother to create an app if it's only cause trouble every time u need to use it!!,1
ff3c5f71-e3eb-486a-82c1-5e42534358d9,Haron K,My rating for this app has plummeted significantly lately among financial apps that I've used. Worst experience and seems buggy, it hangs frequently and randomly unresponsive, not able to connect, etc. Not easy for online payment. Getting tired of all sorts of issue for a financial apps from a Bank. Really needs to buck up and hope security is no compromised though!,2
2992fa9b-3d92-473c-be81-bf9f3e807209,Nolen T,Greetings to whom it might concern. You are a bank institution. There supposedly should not be any crashes, trouble opening, and unable to connect to the server every time. Please do something about this. I am so tired of having to close and open the app every time I wanted to do transactions and approvals. Worst, re-installing for dozens of times. Thus, I had trouble making simple payments. I hope to actually use your banking app smoothly. I look foward to see some improvements.,2
b9070158-aabd-4cda-9a2f-a26c5f5ee4e3,Tanja Jonid,I have no words for how much I hate this app. Recently updated, now my transfer limit can't be changed on the app. It's a different limit from the mobile site, and it's a ridiculously low limit that I can't do anything with. Uninstalling and reinstalling for the umpteenth time and hope (yet again) that this will fix the problem.,1
c85f529d-7bbb-4717-adf9-ac3af6f064f3,Iskandar Zulkarnain,Im so proud of bank islam. Most of the time this app cannot work, always loading screen and server error. However, rather than solving this issue you guys have a great idea by making transactions approval using the go app. So if we successfully log into the portal using web browser, we still need to open the app which is 99% does not work. What a fantastic idea! Btw, stop using AI to reply all reviews. Clearing cache wil not solve anything for this garbage system,1
d63d54df-35b4-47c4-abb3-6aa582025737,lana merry,Please upgrade your apps. Tells me to update, after updating the app, it says cannot connect to the server. Need to uninstall and re-install. Tired of doing the same thing all over again...if i can give u zero star, i would. Worst banking app ever. I don't know how many times already i uninstall and reinstall your app. Don't tell me about phone spec, never encountered this problem on any other banking app. 😤,1
68a824fa-fb24-41ce-88be-6c3990520feb,Mohd Rashdan Jamaludin,Worst ever online banking app I've ever experienced. After having to install, uninstall and reinstall, it still failed to function. Doesn't even deserve 1-star. Please buck up!! and emulate other banks' secure app that have been proven to perform, no need to reinvent the wheel, just get it sorted out before imposing on customers to use such app for our online banking transactions.,1
5e608f89-a009-4be8-9bf2-c558c7249397,z,App not responsive to touch input on landing/login page. Uninstalled and reinstalled still unresponsive, cannot tap 'get started'. Hope can fix soon.,4

147e7950-c984-4b4c-b909-2fbb845e8205,Najla Ramle,I can see this app is improving. My only complaint is that it would be nice if this app would let guest user login using the app that already has a registered user ID. Sometimes, I'm helping my mom doing online transactions when I was at hostel, so it was troublesome to deregistered my Go bank account just to use Go secure using my mom Go bank account.,3
af478f10-679a-4f29-9669-c174e8d0019c,kaito asoka,the app just updated and now i can't even make it to the login screen because of "server error". it's a pain and i need to use the app for online and cashless transactions, do fix this problem ASAP,1

21520ca5-85c4-4659-a9c6-ee993647ae62,SAIFUL AZZRI HAMZAH,Your notification was so bad. No information regarding the need to upgrade, uninstall and reinstall. Your sense of urgency is so bad that you not allow customer to perform transaction right after installing the app. Instead, you asked for a cooling off 12 hours? Are you running a beta version on BIMB customer? You made 12 hours of misery.,1

147c0a04-0b54-4756-8418-b03694adcdaf,Mohd Zairunshah Bernados,Previous update was better than current. Dont know if there any maintenance, app and web both take more time loading and lag when enter it. Please make good your system,1
f0f66978-3a08-4fc7-a3eb-5807f18e65ca,Muhammad Zaini Mohd Hassan,Just wanted to let the devs know that the app was not able to connect to the BIMB server after the latest update. I tried updating, clearing cache, clearing storage and nothing works. It only worked again after reinstalling the app. I loved the app but it will be even more amazing if the GUI is more fluid, though that's just me being picky. Hopefully the next update is smooth as it's been a recurring issue. Kudos to the devs.,4
e1dddb30-da2a-497a-bff0-6da8237eb9ec,Farahin Yusmali,Please fix the app. Sometimes it takes time to load, unable to connect to server but when accessing internet banking through the browser works just fine. A few times I had to reinstall the app just to fix the server error. It annoys me because clearing cache doesn't help at all to reset the connection to server. Why is that a problem? Basically the app becomes completely useless when the error starts popping up, reinstalling is the only option. We use this almost daily now.,1
7ca458e4-cc36-42bf-b6f6-c4022aacee25,M. Noor Akmar,Previous version apps are more batter than current apps. After I updated to a new apps the apps seems having a bad issues. 1. It is hard to open, and it takes more time to open. Loading too long. 2. Even though1 managed to log in, when I choose, as an example, to transfer a money, the apps will be loaded again, and it takes a long time to load. 3. Not so friendly like before, because when I would like to check other things inside the apps, the same issue happens. Please make changes,1

38b55111-a0f6-4b36-b70a-4f3c8de16707,Ain Osman,NOT USER FRIENDLY AT ALL!!! Last review, 1 star on December 2022, until today Nov 2024, this apps does not improve much. They include fingerprint to make the access easier, but not easy at all. I can easily access to see ny account with 1 time using fingerprint eith other banking apps, but not with this app. To open each section, it loading for so long. To get approval for transaction also take some time. What's the point moving to 5G era, but your app still slow.,1
5e2ff49b-496f-497a-8efe-17745b6f2e4d,Haylee Pearl,for the past week I couldn't get pass the starting screen of the app and thus i can never access the app anymore. i have checked if there's any update but there were none and my phone meets the app requirement system. the web browser works fine but it is frustrating bc i can't use the app anymore to do instant transfers. fix this issue please this is too absurd,1
a98df813-6e9d-40ea-83ab-8c3aa26d77fe,Wan Qamarun Najmi,Cannot launch the app. Tried everything and yet the login page never appear, stucked at the front page forever. Read the latest reviews, and the developer keep on telling to update to latest version (3.2.09), which is what everyone already have update to, or use phone with android 9 and above. No solution or whatsover. Very disappointed with how little they care about clients' experience.,1
431e9028-4d86-4db1-b875-6537f99b9f33,BTS phan,The app is so slow, and it will not open at all. I have to uninstall the app and reinstall it every time i want to use the app. After reinstalling, I can only use it once. The second time I try to use it, the same thing happens, and I will have to uninstall again. After reinstalling the app, I can't make any transfers to other banks for the next 12 hours. I feel like closing my account just because of this. This app is not convenient at all. In fact, it is troublesome to the users.,1
9734606e-1789-4696-8006-8cd6d8180516,Muhammad Fakhrullah,Too many errors occuring from time to time Either not being able to log in, not able to use the QR, and even worse, not even able to open the apps even after waiting for quite some time. Had to uninstall then reinstall the app. It is annoying as you need to enter your data all over again,2
5ccadc7b-93d6-4dd5-a564-d6fff10cdf49,Ribbon Hood,PLEASE DO SOMETHING TO THE APPS!! after installed the updated version, it is always loading and stuck at the start up n i cant open the apps. Update on 28 oct 2023, i believe there is no improvement that bank islam done to their apps, which is super non friendly user, lagging, need to open and log in several times, i almost forget my password because rarely use it due to the issues.,1

89390296-5a85-4154-8a9e-946345b0d98e,Amirah A Bakar,25/8/23: Guess I'm not changing my opinion anytime soon. Very, very rarely it was fast. Rest of the time? So slow that I forgot I have to pay for something. Now? I can't even go to the main page, keeps telling me to reinitiate transaction. WT--?? Like I have no life to live, is it, to wait for the app to actually work?,3
f4937d66-f27b-498e-a274-ee345d2d314f,JOE BLACK,the most stupidest banking app.. it will take forever to load. on top of that if you want to perform duitnow transfer through the browser, you still need to open your go app. it's so annoying and it really makes me angry. i have very stable internet connection. Hey bimb please learn from cimb how to operate an app.,1
265fa5d8-4dc6-46a2-80c4-ee4a133012b7,Michelle Angel,Unable to connect the server? Already update the latest version (as of 7 October 2023). Already uninstall and install again to see if it's working, but still doesn't working. If we need to call the center, every user of this app will end up calling Bank Islam. The problem is this app itself.,1
3b96250f-4777-4ae4-a03d-378ebf080242,Azim Kamal,Very disappointing experience using bank islam go, it takes forever just to get to the log in screen, not to mention the problem while scanning qr codes and many more.. what's the point of yall taking RM 13 from our bank accounts if you didn't do anything to fix the goddamn app..no one will be furious if there is a slight inconvenience for a short period of time, but this app has been giving people nothing but trouble for quite some time..please step up your IT teams,1
aca6785a-9dcc-4d7a-a3fb-5c4c0a417478,Mariani Shaffee,Why i kept getting error "400 bad request", although i already key in my correct password and id also the tac number. After that error, the app send me msg that i already registered yet unable to to log in. Please resolve this, i already uninstall and reinstall for several time.. Dear BIMB, Again this app really needs improvement. As from all customers that seems to have the same issues, we really need you to solves it fast for us to used it again.,1

Why in the world does everything need verification from the app anyway, the duitnow I get, the jompay I get, but why funds transfer too????,2
9bc38b21-0930-4b5f-bbf5-634d4ec9c21e,Alia Amir,Sometimes it's working.... sometimes NOT. It continues to buffer. So unfriendly users. In fact my phone is new, install & uninstall 3 times by now & updated the apps to the latest version. But still the SAME prob reoccurring. Fix you apps pls!,1

Requested for so many times still did not received any In case of emergency to do any transaction, this is very much troublesome. Transaction via website also need approval from GO Bimb. How to if I can't even open the apps ?,1
6afe2ca2-6810-455d-aa0f-8eaa2b1f948e,Hehettwaffle,I will be honest. This app is the worst. The loading takes too long for me to open the app. If its only a minute or two is okay but it takes 5 mintues or even more just to load? I've heard the issue is not new which proves this app is just that bad.,1
1215902f-97d1-4642-8c49-c36953414f1a,Alaina Hasan,I've already updated to the new version but still couldn't open the app.. I don't know why it cannot connect to the server. I've tried using both wifi and data but still can't open.,1
41f2d087-cbbf-4c61-abc7-ed47e3084af1,Mr Eddy,Very bad apps.. Always stuck and nothing happened after wait 10 minutes. Causing me very bad experience to transfer money using western Union and PFX with your apps. Very very very bad!!!!,1
4a01a5e4-6f11-4b67-bdd4-09e7cda3e0e3,natasya rahim,the apps are so bad, clear cache, etc, still unable to open the apps. Online transactions through the website need approval through GO secure, but nothing can be approved since the apps only trying to load the entire time,1
c469fd5d-a5d1-4a8a-b8a9-36d6d2440686,Atiqa Syazwani,Took super long to open the apps. Most of the time i gave up. Would rather transfer all my money to other banks, easier when i need to do duitnow payment at the store. Im super close to stop using this app.,1
c9b55ae9-4264-484e-997b-e894ff157052,Anisah binti Mohd Fauzie,I mean i understand that many people are using this app, but you have to accommodate good service to them. Make frequent maintenance, if u already did u have to make it even more frequent. Please people are just trying to get their transactions through and if u are wishing to keep them as customers, please improve.,2
d0b5234a-1de3-40a9-98c2-8646af62597e,pakdee pakdee,Frequently got problem to share the transaction receipt. There are 2 ways to share receipt in GO apps .... thru (menu) history mobile transaction or thru individual account transaction history. Both got blank receipt. My phone OS is Android version 13. GO apps version 3.2.09.,3
7e246918-3b1e-4f66-9b71-087e804f583f,hayati syamimi,The app was very very veryyyyyy slowwwwww!!!!!! Couldn't make any transactions with this app. I am beyond disappointed. Edit: after the recent update, there's no more slow loading so i think they deseve more star,4
a6cb3130-ce0a-4336-926e-48cd5d4d1854,Malaya FreeSpirit,i want to carry out fpx transaction. so i need to use go app to approve the transaction. and goes on loading till the last 120s of the transaction. and when i got at the login page press go secure to approve the transaction. it repeatly tell me the transaction has expired, when i still have 120s. i did a few more time with the same result till transaction have really expired. ok i give another go, i reinstall the app, reregistered it for 3 more time to do the fpx and it still waste my time,1
67191fc0-6a15-4860-bfcc-2222afee86dd,Norhanisah Nasran,From bad to worse. It was already laggy and slow before. Since the update, takes close to forever to load(my internet is running at 500mbps) . And the interface is very buggy. I can't do any transactions just an endless loop of returning to the home screen. I end up using chrome or my PC for any online transactions. Please this app really needs a major update & revamp. At a time when most things are online you might loose more customers bcoz other app(bank) are better,1
26854261-e53a-4426-8dd1-676db3459c5b,DinLite22,If there is an option to give 0 star, damn sure I'd give it without hesitation. Every time updates coming this app has become much much worse than before. Please fix your app and your server so we can log in without issue. Fix the damn issue asap or else we will port to another bank.,1
d6381c8f-5005-4b97-bf6d-3cca74de5c0d,Abah Eyan,Half an hour loading to open the apps. Very very very bad apps for such a big finance company. Please let us used the browser instead of this app.. I repeat.. Very.. Very....very very.. Bad and junk apps.,1
205ad67c-d94f-48e1-81de-4fcbc460357b,Vanesea Maie,I hate this app ever.... From September until the end of October, this app can't perform well even i have updated it... I can't do anything to my money in the bank. Already made some reports via email and call centre for this issue. Seem like no action from them.,1
c6172253-350f-4d5d-b9e7-82b9747c5676,Muhammad Yusoff Jamaluddin,Not intuitive to use. I cancelled my transfer settings and press OK on the dialog option, nothing happened, not even to the homepage. I tap on back button and the app not responding at all. Can't even find ASNB account summary or related (not transaction) but the bank have that service, really not good. Edit: No error, I wrote "Nothing happened" means I got any feedback from that? No, you didn't code any error message. That's even worst.,1
518e75cd-90e0-4592-a04e-e3da8a52858b,Amirul Shahril Azizi,Unable to login,Already clear and uninstall the app.Still get the same error. There is no more,Go secure for approve transaction purpose.It is very dangerous since no safety in online transaction. YES,this is the latest version of app.,1
f7a567c2-e0d9-4973-a7a9-117a7a0cca61,Winter Jasmine,Worst app ever exist! Very slow and u need to activate go secure even for small amount transfer. Waste of time!! Once lag, it's going to lag forever.. in the end, need to uninstall and install it again. No improvement despite people giving reviews. Don't bother to create an app if it's only cause trouble every time u need to use it!!,1
ff3c5f71-e3eb-486a-82c1-5e42534358d9,Haron K,My rating for this app has plummeted significantly lately among financial apps that I've used. Worst experience and seems buggy, it hangs frequently and randomly unresponsive, not able to connect, etc. Not easy for online payment. Getting tired of all sorts of issue for a financial apps from a Bank. Really needs to buck up and hope security is no compromised though!,2
2992fa9b-3d92-473c-be81-bf9f3e807209,Nolen T,Greetings to whom it might concern. You are a bank institution. There supposedly should not be any crashes, trouble opening, and unable to connect to the server every time. Please do something about this. I am so tired of having to close and open the app every time I wanted to do transactions and approvals. Worst, re-installing for dozens of times. Thus, I had trouble making simple payments. I hope to actually use your banking app smoothly. I look foward to see some improvements.,2
b9070158-aabd-4cda-9a2f-a26c5f5ee4e3,Tanja Jonid,I have no words for how much I hate this app. Recently updated, now my transfer limit can't be changed on the app. It's a different limit from the mobile site, and it's a ridiculously low limit that I can't do anything with. Uninstalling and reinstalling for the umpteenth time and hope (yet again) that this will fix the problem.,1
c85f529d-7bbb-4717-adf9-ac3af6f064f3,Iskandar Zulkarnain,Im so proud of bank islam. Most of the time this app cannot work, always loading screen and server error. However, rather than solving this issue you guys have a great idea by making transactions approval using the go app. So if we successfully log into the portal using web browser, we still need to open the app which is 99% does not work. What a fantastic idea! Btw, stop using AI to reply all reviews. Clearing cache wil not solve anything for this garbage system,1
d63d54df-35b4-47c4-abb3-6aa582025737,lana merry,Please upgrade your apps. Tells me to update, after updating the app, it says cannot connect to the server. Need to uninstall and re-install. Tired of doing the same thing all over again...if i can give u zero star, i would. Worst banking app ever. I don't know how many times already i uninstall and reinstall your app. Don't tell me about phone spec, never encountered this problem on any other banking app. 😤,1
68a824fa-fb24-41ce-88be-6c3990520feb,Mohd Rashdan Jamaludin,Worst ever online banking app I've ever experienced. After having to install, uninstall and reinstall, it still failed to function. Doesn't even deserve 1-star. Please buck up!! and emulate other banks' secure app that have been proven to perform, no need to reinvent the wheel, just get it sorted out before imposing on customers to use such app for our online banking transactions.,1
5e608f89-a009-4be8-9bf2-c558c7249397,z,App not responsive to touch input on landing/login page. Uninstalled and reinstalled still unresponsive, cannot tap 'get started'. Hope can fix soon.,4
a6b7bd53-290f-4838-b291-357081330fd5,Tur Key,Actually not bad if you compare with other bank software. User friendly UI, Easy to use, just abit slow sometimes. Other all good for me.,5
72e4750a-5373-4b15-b03d-e39f9eda6111,Zulfadhli Aini,After update, cannot connect to the server. Need to uninstall and install it again. Loading time too long when need to do secure pay, untill timeout. Not much improvement compare to other internet banking apps after a year from my last reviewed.,2
